year, and EPA has proposed more stringent heavy-duty standards beginning with the 2027 model year.", "These rules include more stringent emissions standards, as well as new requirements affecting durability testing, warranty, and OBD.", "CARB has also adopted new light-duty emissions standards applicable to 2026 model year vehicles, including a more stringent emissions standard and other new emissions requirements.", "These new rules are expected to impose increased challenges and costs on the development of light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty engines.", "Compliance with automobile emissions standards depends in part on the widespread availability of high-quality and consistent automotive fuels that the vehicles were designed to use.", "Legislative, regulatory, and judicial developments related to fuel quality at both the national and state levels could affect vehicle manufacturers’ warranty costs as well as their ability to comply with vehicle emissions standards.", "The California vehicle emissions program also includes requirements for manufacturers to produce and deliver for sale zero-emission vehicles (“ZEVs”).", "California’s light-duty vehicle ZEV regulation, which uses a system based on credits that can be banked and carried forward, mandates annual increases in the production and sale of battery-electric, fuel cell, and plug-in hybrid vehicles.", "For 2025 model year, this regulation will require approximately 22% of a manufacturer’s California light-duty vehicle sales volume be ZEVs.", "In August 2022, California approved a sweeping revision to the ZEV regulation.", "Beginning with the 2026 model year, the revised ZEV rule mandates a 35% ZEV sales requirement, rising to 100% by 2035.", "The revised regulation also imposes significant restrictions on credit usage, and new requirements for EV battery durability.", "California has also instituted ZEV regulations governing medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, beginning with the 2024 model year.", "These stringent ZEV requirements covering light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles could entail significant costs and compliance challenges, and include complex warranty and recall requirements.", "Compliance with ZEV rules depends on market conditions (including the pace of adoption of EVs), technology readiness, and battery raw material availability as well as the availability of adequate infrastructure to support vehicle charging.", "European Requirements.", "European Union (“EU”) and U.K. regulations, directives, and related legislation limit the amount of regulated pollutants that may be emitted by new motor vehicles and engines sold in the EU and the United Kingdom.", "Regulatory stringency has increased significantly with the application of Stage VI emission standards (first introduced in 2014) and the implementation of a laboratory test cycle for CO2 and emissions and the introduction of on-road emission testing using portable emission analyzers (Real Driving Emission or “RDE”).", "These on-road emission tests are in addition to the laboratory-based tests (first introduced in 2017).", "The divergence between the regulatory limit that is tested in laboratory conditions and the allowed values measured in RDE tests will ultimately be reduced to zero as the regulatory demands increase.", "In addition, new requirements for tailpipe and non-tailpipe emissions will be included in the upcoming Euro 7 regulation, and the lead-time for engineering and type approval may potentially be too short.", "The costs associated with complying with all of these requirements are significant, and following the EU Commission’s indication of its intent to accelerate emissions rules in its road map publication “EU Green Deal” as well as the EU sustainable mobility action plan, these challenges will continue in European markets, including the United Kingdom.", "In addition, the Whole Vehicle Type Approval (“WVTA”) regulation has been updated to increase the stringency of in-market surveillance.", "Moreover, following the U.K.’s withdrawal from the European Union, we may be subject to diverging requirements in our European markets, which could increase vehicle complexity and duties.", "There is an increasing trend of city access restrictions for internal combustion engine powered vehicles.", "The access rules being introduced are developed by individual cities based on their specific concerns, resulting in rapid deployment of access rules that differ greatly among cities.", "The speed of implementation of access rules may directly influence customer vehicle residual values and choice of next purchase.", "In an effort to support the Paris Accord, some countries are adopting yearly increases in CO2 taxes, where such a system is in place, and publishing dates by when internal combustion powered vehicles may no longer be registered, e.g., Norway in 2025 and the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in 2030.", "Other National Requirements.", "Many countries, in an effort to address air quality and climate change concerns, are adopting previous versions of European or United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (“UN-ECE”) mobile source emission regulations.", "Some countries have adopted more advanced regulations based on the most recent version of European or U.S. regulations.", "For example, the China Stage VI light-duty vehicle emission standards, based on European Stage VI emission standards for light-duty vehicles, U.S. evaporative and refueling emissions standards, and CARB OBD II requirements, incorporate two levels of stringency for tailpipe emissions.", "Under the level one (VI(a)) standard, which is currently in place nationwide in China, the emissions limits are comparable to the EU Stage VI limits, except for carbon monoxide, which is 30% lower than the EU Stage VI limit.", "The more stringent level two (VI(b)) standard’s emissions limits are approximately 30-50% lower than the EU Stage VI limits, depending on the pollutant.", "While level two (VI(b)) is not slated for nationwide implementation until July 2023, the government has encouraged the more economically developed cities and provinces to pull ahead implementation.", "For example, Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hebei province, and Guangdong province have all begun implementing level two (VI(b)).", "Both China Stage VII light-duty vehicle and heavy duty vehicle emission regulations are currently under pre-study, and the Ministry of Ecology and Environment has advised that the Stage VII regulations will have more stringent limits on pollutant emissions and will establish limits for greenhouse gas (primarily CO2) tailpipe emissions.", "In South America, most countries are evolving to implement more stringent requirements accepting Europe and U.S. regulations, except Brazil, which has a unique local process called PROCONVE based on U.S. regulations for light-duty vehicles and European regulations for heavy-duty vehicles.", "Canadian criteria emissions regulations are largely aligned with U.S. requirements; however, the existing ZEV regulations in Quebec and those published in British Columbia in July 2020 are more stringent than those in place in California.", "Both British Columbia and Quebec have proposed draft amendments to their regulations to increase requirements starting in 2025 and 2026, respectively.", "The federal government has published draft light-duty ZEV sales requirements through an amendment to the Passenger Automobile and Light Truck Greenhouse Gas Emission Regulations and has also published its intent to develop ZEV sales requirements for heavy-duty vehicles.", "Other provinces have signaled their interest in light-duty ZEV sales regulations but are awaiting the finalization of the federal ZEV regulations.", "Elsewhere, there is a mix of regulations and processes based on U.S. and EU standards.", "Not all countries have adopted appropriate fuel quality standards to accompany the stringent emission standards adopted.", "This could lead to compliance problems, particularly if OBD or in-use surveillance requirements are implemented.", "Global Developments.", "In recent years, EPA and CARB have increased their focus on the use of “defeat devices.” Defeat devices are elements of design (typically embedded in software) that improperly cause the emission control system to function less effectively during normal on-road driving than during an official laboratory emissions test, without justification.", "They are prohibited by law in many jurisdictions, and we do not use defeat devices in our vehicles.", "Regulators around the world continue to scrutinize automakers’ emission testing, which has led to a number of defeat device settlements by various manufacturers.", "EPA is carrying out additional non-standard tests as part of its vehicle certification program.", "CARB has also been conducting extensive non-standard emission tests, which in some cases have resulted in certification delays for diesel vehicles.", "In the past, several European countries have conducted non-standard emission tests and published the results, and, in some cases, this supplemental testing has triggered investigations of manufacturers for possible defeat devices.", "Testing is expected to continue on an ongoing basis.", "In addition, plaintiffs’ attorneys are pursuing consumer class action lawsuits based on alleged excessive emissions from cars and trucks, which could, in turn, prompt further investigations by regulators.", "U.S.", "Requirements - Light-Duty Vehicles.", "Federal law requires that light-duty vehicles meet minimum corporate average fuel economy (“CAFE”) standards set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”).", "Manufacturers are subject to substantial civil penalties if they fail to meet the CAFE standard in any model year, after taking into account all available credits for the preceding five model years and expected credits for the three succeeding model years.", "The law requires NHTSA to promulgate and enforce separate CAFE standards applicable to each manufacturer’s fleet of domestic passenger cars, imported passenger cars, and light-duty trucks.", "EPA also regulates vehicle greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions under the Clean Air Act.", "Because the vast majority of GHGs emitted by a vehicle are the result of fuel combustion, GHG emission standards are similar to fuel economy standards.", "Thus, NHTSA and EPA coordinate with each other on their fuel economy and GHG standards, respectively, to avoid potential inconsistencies.", "Beginning with the 2012 model year, EPA and NHTSA jointly promulgated harmonized GHG and fuel economy regulations under what came to be known as the “One National Program” (“ONP”) framework.", "California, which had promulgated its own state-specific set of GHG regulations, agreed that compliance with the federal program would satisfy compliance with its own GHG requirements, thereby avoiding a patchwork of potentially conflicting federal and state GHG standards.", "ONP has required manufacturers to achieve increasingly stringent year-over-year standards.", "ONP was envisioned to continue at least through the 2025 model year.", "In 2020, EPA introduced significantly less stringent fuel economy and GHG standards applicable to model years 2021-2026.", "The federal government also revoked California’s authority to set and enforce its own vehicle GHG standards, as well as the authority of other states that opted in to California’s standards.", "California continued to assert its authority to regulate vehicle GHGs, challenged in court the federal government’s preemption actions, withdrew from ONP, and planned to return to enforcing its own state-specific GHG standards.", "The litigation over both standards and preemption, with uncertain outcomes, created difficulty for purposes of Ford’s future product planning.", "To avoid a “bifurcated” regulatory scenario in which California and the 15 other states that adopted California’s GHG standards enforce one set of rules, while a different set of rules applies in the rest of the country, Ford reached an agreement with California on a set of terms for an alternative framework in which Ford committed to meet a designated set of standards on a national basis in lieu of the California regulatory program.", "This framework enabled Ford to continue its product planning on a nationwide basis, while being consistent with Ford’s environmental goals.", "Ford finalized its agreement with California in 2020, and other states that adopted the California standards indicated they would respect the agreement.", "In 2021, EPA again re-evaluated the stringency of light-duty fuel economy and GHG standards through the 2026 model year, and considered whether to restore the stringency to the previous ONP levels, or greater.", "EPA finalized this evaluation in December 2021, establishing GHG standards applicable to model years 2023-2026 with stringency that exceeded ONP levels.", "In 2022, NHTSA finalized more stringent fuel economy standards for model years 2024-2026, which are substantially aligned with EPA’s GHG standards.", "The federal government also acted in December 2021 to repeal its rule blocking California’s authority to set and enforce its own vehicle GHG standards, as well as the authority of other states that adopted California’s standards, and EPA took similar action in early 2022 under the Clean Air Act.", "In late 2022, EPA began consideration of sweeping changes to light-duty GHG regulations for model years 2027 and beyond.", "These regulations are expected to extend through at least the 2030 model year, and to drive significant ZEV sales mix, along with rapid improvement of ICE vehicle performance, by virtue of greatly increased stringency.", "These new rules are expected to impose increased challenges and costs on the development of light-duty vehicles.", "If any federal or state agency imposes and enforces fuel economy and GHG standards that are misaligned with market conditions, Ford would likely be forced to take various actions that could have substantial adverse effects on its sales volumes and results of operations.", "Such actions likely would include restricting offerings of selected engines and popular options; increasing market support programs for Ford’s most fuel-efficient vehicles; and ultimately curtailing the production and sale of certain vehicles, such as high-performance cars, utilities, and/or full-size light trucks in order to maintain compliance.", "U.S.", "Requirements - Heavy-Duty Vehicles.", "EPA and NHTSA have jointly promulgated GHG and fuel economy standards for heavy-duty vehicles (generally, vehicles over 8,500 pounds gross vehicle weight rating) through the 2027 model year, and EPA is preparing a major update to these standards for the 2027 model year and beyond.", "In Ford’s case, the standards primarily affect heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans, plus vocational vehicles such as shuttle buses and delivery trucks.", "As the heavy-duty standards increase in stringency, it may become more difficult to comply while continuing to offer a full lineup of heavy-duty trucks.", "European Requirements.", "The European Union regulates passenger car and light commercial vehicle CO2 emissions using sliding scales with different CO2 targets for each manufacturer based on the respective average vehicle weight for its fleet of vehicles first registered in a calendar year, with separate targets for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.", "A penalty system applies to manufacturers failing to meet the individual CO2 targets.", "Pooling agreements between manufacturers to utilize credits are possible under certain conditions, and we have entered into such pooling agreements in order to comply with fuel economy regulations without paying a penalty and to enable other manufacturers to benefit from our positive CO2 performance.", "For “multi-stage vehicles” (e.g., Ford’s Transit chassis cabs), the base manufacturer (e.g., Ford) is fully responsible for the CO2 performance of the final up-fitted vehicles.", "The initial target levels get significantly more stringent every five years (2025, 2030, and 2035, after which all new vehicles must be zero emission), requiring significant investments in propulsion technologies and extensive fleet management forcing low CO2 emissions.", "The United Kingdom and Switzerland have introduced similar rules, and the United Kingdom is considering adopting ZEV mandates.", "The EU Commission is investigating the introduction of Real Driving CO2 and Life Cycle Assessment elements, and heavy-duty vehicles are addressed in separate regulations with analogous requirements and challenges.", "As discussed above, the EU Commission has announced a “Green Deal” that is likely to trigger more stringent requirements for CO2 emissions (including stricter CO2 fleet regulations) and other regulated emissions and include recycling and substance restrictions.", "While the EU Commission targets net climate neutrality by 2050 and a more ambitious 2030 interim target (a 55% instead of 40% CO2 reduction compared to 1990), several countries, such as Germany, have adopted stricter interim targets and earlier net climate neutrality targets.", "Ford also faces the risk of advance premium payments for both passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in all European markets due to, for example, unexpected market fluctuations and shorter lead times impacting average fleet performance.", "The United Nations developed a technical regulation for passenger car emissions and CO2.", "This world light-duty test procedure (“WLTP”) is focused primarily on better aligning laboratory CO2 and fuel consumption figures with customer- reported figures.", "The introduction of WLTP in Europe started in September 2017 and requires updates to CO2 labeling, thereby impacting taxes in countries with a CO2 tax scheme as well as CO2 fleet regulations for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.", "Costs associated with new or incremental testing for WLTP are significant.", "Some European countries have implemented or are considering other initiatives for reducing CO2 vehicle emissions, including fiscal measures and CO2 labeling to address country specific targets associated with the Paris Accord.", "For example, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands, among others, have introduced taxation based on CO2 emissions.", "The EU CO2 requirements are likely to trigger further measures.", "In addition, delayed vehicle launches and supply shortages, as well as an insufficient charging infrastructure and lower demand for ZEV and low CO2 emission vehicles as certain electric vehicle incentives are reduced, can trigger compliance risks in all European markets.", "Other National Requirements.", "The Canadian federal government regulates vehicle GHG emissions under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.", "In

critical to the success of our Ford+ plan.", "If we are unable to optimize our capital allocation among vehicles, services, technology, and other calls on capital, or we are otherwise not successful in executing Ford+ (or are delayed for reasons outside of our control), we may not be able to realize the full benefits of our plan, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.", "Furthermore, if we fail to make progress on our plan at the pace that shareholders expect, it may lead to an increase in shareholder activism, which may disrupt the conduct of our business and divert management’s attention and resources.", "Ford’s vehicles could be affected by defects that result in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, or increased warranty costs.", "Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy defects related to vehicle safety through safety recall campaigns, and a manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines that the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard.", "We may also be obligated to remedy defects or potentially recall our vehicles due to defective components provided to us by our suppliers, arising from their quality issues or otherwise.", "NHTSA’s enforcement strategy has resulted in significant civil penalties being levied and the use of consent orders requiring direct oversight by NHTSA of certain manufacturers’ safety processes, a trend that could continue.", "Should we or government safety regulators determine that a safety or other defect or a noncompliance exists with respect to certain of our vehicles prior to the start of production, the launch of such vehicle could be delayed until such defect is remedied.", "The cost of recall and customer satisfaction actions to remedy defects in vehicles that have been sold could be substantial, particularly if the actions relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production.", "For example, NHTSA and the automotive industry are currently engaged in a study of the safety of approximately 56 million Takata desiccated airbag inflators in the United States.", "Of these, approximately three and a half million of the inflators are in our vehicles.", "Should NHTSA determine that the inflators contain a safety defect, Ford and other manufacturers could potentially face significant incremental recall costs.", "Further, to the extent recall and customer satisfaction actions relate to defective components we receive from suppliers, our ability to recover from the suppliers may be limited by the suppliers’ financial condition.", "We accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages and field service actions at the time a vehicle is sold, and we reevaluate the adequacy of our accruals on a regular basis.", "In addition, from time to time, we issue extended warranties at our expense, the estimated cost of which is accrued at the time of issuance.", "For additional information regarding warranty and field service action costs, including our process for establishing our reserves, see “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Item 7 and Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.", "If warranty costs are greater than anticipated as a result of increased vehicle and component complexity, the adoption of new technologies, or otherwise, such costs could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.", "Furthermore, launch delays, recall actions, and increased warranty costs could adversely affect our reputation or market acceptance of our products as discussed below under “Ford’s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries, and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced.”", "Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, or new business strategies.", "We have invested in, formed strategic alliances with, and announced or formed joint ventures with a number of companies, and we may expand those relationships or enter into similar relationships with additional companies.", "These initiatives typically involve enormous complexity, may require a significant amount of capital, and may involve a lengthy regulatory approval process.", "As a result, we may not be able to complete anticipated transactions, the anticipated benefits of these transactions may not be realized, or the benefits may be delayed.", "For example, we may not successfully integrate an alliance or joint venture with our operations, including the implementation of our controls, systems, procedures, and policies, or unforeseen expenses or liabilities may arise that were not discovered during due diligence prior to an investment or entry into a strategic alliance, or a misalignment of interests may develop between us and the other party.", "Further, to the extent we share ownership, control, or management with another party in a joint venture, our ability to influence the joint venture may be limited, and we may be unable to prevent misconduct or implement our compliance or internal control systems.", "In order to secure critical materials for production of electric vehicles, we have entered into and plan to continue to enter into offtake agreements and other long-term purchase contracts with raw materials suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers; however, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these actions and our efforts to have such suppliers, particularly those in less developed markets, adopt Ford’s sustainability and other standards may be unsuccessful, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation.", "In addition, a restructuring or the implementation of a new or different business strategy may lead to the disruption of our existing business operations, including distracting management from current operations.", "Results of operations from new activities may be lower than our existing activities, and, if a strategy is unsuccessful, we may not recoup our investments, which may be significant, in that strategy.", "Moreover, we may continue to have financial exposure following a strategic divestiture or cessation of operations in a market, and restructuring actions may cause us to incur significant costs, record impairments or other charges, subject us to potential claims from employees, suppliers, dealers, or governmental authorities or harm our reputation.", "Failure to successfully and timely realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions or strategies described herein could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.", "Operational systems, security systems, vehicles, and services could be affected by cyber incidents, ransomware attacks, and other disruptions and impact Ford and Ford Credit as well as their suppliers and dealers.", "We rely on information technology networks and systems, including in-vehicle systems and mobile devices, some of which are managed by suppliers, to process, transmit, and store electronic information that is important to the operation of our business, our vehicles, and the services we offer.", "Despite security measures, we are at risk for interruptions, outages, and compromises of: (i) operational systems (including business, financial, accounting, product development, consumer receivables, data processing, or manufacturing processes); (ii) facility security systems; and/or (iii) in-vehicle systems or mobile devices, whether caused by a ransomware or other cyber attack, security breach, or other reasons, e.g., a natural disaster, fire, acts of terrorism or war, or an overburdened infrastructure system.", "Such incidents could materially disrupt operational systems; result in loss of trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information; compromise the privacy of personal information of consumers, employees, or others; jeopardize the security of our facilities; affect the performance of in-vehicle systems or services we offer; and/or impact the safety of our vehicles.", "This risk exposure rises as we continue to develop and produce vehicles with increased connectivity.", "Moreover, we, our suppliers, and our dealers have been the target of cyber attacks in the past, and such attacks will continue and evolve in the future, which may cause cyber incidents to be more difficult to detect for periods of time.", "Our networks and in-vehicle systems, sharing similar architectures, could also be impacted by, or a data breach may result from, the negligence or misconduct of insiders or third parties who have access to our networks and systems.", "We continually employ capabilities, processes, and other security measures designed to reduce and mitigate the risk of cyber attacks, and we rely on our suppliers to do the same for their operations; however, we may not be aware of all vulnerabilities and such preventative measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be sufficient in all circumstances or mitigate all potential risks, including potential production disruption.", "Moreover, a cyber incident could harm our reputation, cause customers to lose trust in our security measures, and/or subject us to regulatory actions or litigation, which may result in fines, penalties, judgments, or injunctions, and a cyber incident involving us or one of our suppliers could impact production, our internal operations, or our ability to deliver products and services to our customers.", "Ford’s production, as well as Ford’s suppliers’ production, and/or the ability to deliver products to consumers could be disrupted by labor issues, natural or man-made disasters, adverse effects of climate change, financial distress, production difficulties, capacity limitations, or other factors.", "A work stoppage or other limitation on production could occur at Ford’s facilities, at a facility in its supply chain, or at one of its logistics providers for any number of reasons, including as a result of labor issues, including shortages of available employees, disputes under existing collective bargaining agreements with labor unions or in connection with negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements, absenteeism, public health issues (e.g., COVID-19), stay-at-home orders, or in response to potential restructuring actions (e.g., plant closures); as a result of supplier financial distress or other production constraints, such as limited quantities of components, including but not limited to semiconductors, or raw materials, quality issues, capacity limitations, or other difficulties; as a result of a natural disaster (including climate-related physical risk); cyber incidents; or for other reasons.", "Further, the limited availability of components, labor shortages, COVID-19, and supplier operating issues has led to an inconsistent production schedule at our facilities.", "This has exacerbated the disruption to our suppliers’ operations, which, in turn, has led to higher costs and production shortfalls.", "Given the worldwide scope of our supply chain and operations, we and our suppliers face a risk of disruption or operating inefficiencies that may increase costs due to the adverse physical effects of climate change, which are predicted to increase the frequency and severity of weather and other natural events, e.g., wildfires, extended droughts, and extreme temperatures.", "In addition, in the event a weather-related event, strike, international conflict, or other occurrence limits the ability of freight carriers to deliver components and other materials from suppliers to us or logistics providers to transport our vehicles for an extended period of time, it may increase our costs and delay or otherwise impact both our production operations and customers’ ability to receive our vehicles.", "Many components used in our vehicles are available only from a single or limited number of suppliers and, therefore, cannot be re-sourced quickly or inexpensively to another supplier (due to long lead times, new contractual commitments that may be required by another supplier before ramping up to provide the components or materials, etc.).", "Such suppliers also could threaten to disrupt our production as leverage in negotiations.", "In addition, when we undertake a model changeover, significant downtime at one or more of our production facilities may be required, and our ability to return to full production may be delayed if we experience production difficulties at one of our facilities or a supplier’s facility.", "Moreover, as vehicles, components, and their integration become more complex, we may face an increased risk of a delay in production of new vehicles.", "Regardless of the cause, our ability to recoup lost production volume may be limited.", "Accordingly, a significant disruption to our production schedule could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and may impact our strategy to comply with fuel economy standards as discussed below under “Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations.”", "Ford’s ability to maintain a competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraints.", "The vast majority of the hourly employees in our Ford Blue and Ford Model e manufacturing operations in the United States and Canada are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements.", "These agreements provide guaranteed wage and benefit levels throughout the contract term and some degree of income security, subject to certain conditions.", "These agreements may restrict our ability to close plants and divest businesses.", "A substantial number of our employees in other regions are represented by unions or government councils, and legislation or custom promoting retention of manufacturing or other employment in the state, country, or region may constrain as a practical matter our ability to sell or close manufacturing or other facilities.", "Ford’s ability to attract and retain talented, diverse, and highly skilled employees is critical to its success and competitiveness.", "Our success depends on our ability to continue to recruit and retain talented and diverse employees who are highly skilled in engineering, software, technology (including digital capabilities and connectivity), marketing, and finance, among other areas.", "Competition for such employees is intense, which has led to an increase in compensation throughout a tight labor market, and, accordingly, may increase costs for employers.", "We have struggled to hire and retain salaried, skilled hourly, and production hourly employees in some of our manufacturing and parts, supplies, and logistics locations.", "In addition to compensation considerations, current and potential employees are increasingly placing a premium on various intangibles, such as working for companies with a clear purpose and strong brand reputation, flexible work arrangements, and other considerations, such as embracing sustainability and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.", "If we are not perceived as an employer of choice, we may be unable to recruit highly skilled employees.", "Further, if we lose existing employees with needed skills, or we are unable to upskill and develop existing employees, particularly with the introduction of new technologies, it could have a substantial adverse effect on our business.", "Ford’s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries, and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced.", "Although we conduct extensive market research before launching new or refreshed vehicles and introducing new services, many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products and services in the marketplace, and we may not be able to accurately predict or identify emerging trends or preferences or the success of new products or services in the market.", "It takes years to design and develop a new vehicle or change an existing vehicle.", "Because customers’ preferences may change quickly, our new and existing products may not generate sales in sufficient quantities and at costs low enough to be profitable and recoup investment costs.", "Offering vehicles and services that customers want and value can mitigate the risks of increasing price competition and declining demand, but products and services that are perceived to be less desirable (whether in terms of price, quality, styling, safety, overall value, fuel efficiency, or other attributes) can exacerbate these risks.", "For example, if we are unable to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors, develop innovative new products and services, or sufficiently tailor our products and services to customers in other markets, there could be insufficient demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.", "With increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet, social media, and other media, mere allegations relating to quality, safety, fuel efficiency, sustainability, corporate social responsibility, or other key attributes can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our products or services, even where such allegations prove to be inaccurate or unfounded.", "Further, our ability to successfully grow through capacity expansion and investments in the areas of electrification, connectivity, digital and physical services, and software services depends on many factors, including advancements in technology, regulatory changes, infrastructure development (e.g., a widespread vehicle charging network), and other factors that are difficult to predict, that may significantly affect the future of electric and autonomous vehicles, digital and physical services, and software services.", "The automotive, software, and digital service businesses are very competitive and are undergoing rapid changes.", "Traditional competitors are expanding their offerings, and new types of competitors (particularly in our areas of strength, e.g., pick-up trucks, utilities, and commercial vehicles) that may possess superior technology, may have business models with certain aspects that are more efficient, and are not subject to the same level of fixed costs as us, are entering the market.", "This level of competition increases the importance of our ability to anticipate, develop, and deliver products and services that customers desire on a timely basis, in quantities in line with demand, and at costs low enough to be profitable.", "We have announced our intent to continue making multi-billion dollar investments in electrification and software services.", "Our plans include offering electrified versions of many of our vehicles, including the F-150 Lightning and E-Transit.", "If the market for electrified vehicles does not develop at the rate we expect, even if the regulatory framework encourages a rapid adoption of electrified vehicles, there is a negative perception of our vehicles or about electric vehicles in general, or if consumers prefer our competitors’ vehicles, there could be an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.", "Further, as discussed below under “Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations,” lower than planned market acceptance of our vehicles may impact our strategy to comply with fuel economy standards.", "Ford is addressing its impact on climate change aligned with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (Paris Agreement) by working to reduce our carbon footprint over time across our vehicles, operations, and supply chain.", "We have announced interim emissions targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and made other statements about similar initiatives, e.g., our expected electric vehicle volumes in future years.", "Achievement of these initiatives will require significant investments and the implementation of new processes; however, there is no assurance that the desired outcomes will be achieved.", "To the extent we are unable to achieve these initiatives or our transition to electrification is slower than expected, it may harm our reputation or we may not otherwise receive the expected return on the investment.", "For example, we are exposed to reputational risk if we do not reduce vehicle CO2 emissions in line with our targets or in compliance with applicable regulations.", "Further, our customers and investors evaluate how well we are progressing on our announced climate goals and aspirations, and if we are not on track to achieve those goals and aspirations on a timely basis, or if the expectations of our customers and investors change and we do not adequately address their expectations, our reputation could be impacted, and customers may choose to purchase the products and services of, investors may choose to invest in, and suppliers and vendors may choose to do business with other companies.", "Moreover, new offerings, including those related to electric vehicles and autonomous driving technologies, may present technological challenges that could be costly to implement and overcome and may subject us to customer claims if they do not operate as anticipated.", "In addition, since new technologies are subject to market acceptance, a malfunction involving any manufacturer’s autonomous vehicle may negatively impact the perception of autonomous vehicles and erode customer trust.", "Ford’s results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United States.", "A shift in consumer preferences away from larger, more profitable vehicles with internal combustion engines (including trucks and utilities) to electric or other vehicles in our portfolio that may be less profitable could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.", "If demand for electric vehicles grows at a rate greater than our ability to increase our production capacity for those vehicles, lower market share and revenue, as well as facility and other asset-related charges (e.g., accelerated depreciation) associated with the production of internal combustion vehicles, may result.", "In addition, government regulations aimed at reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency (e.g., ZEV mandates and low emission zones) and other factors that accelerate the transition to electric vehicles may increase the cost of vehicles by more than the perceived benefit to consumers and dampen margins.", "With a global footprint, Ford’s results could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments, including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events.", "Because of the interconnectedness of the global economy, the challenges of a pandemic, a financial crisis, economic downturn or recession, natural disaster, war, geopolitical crises, or other significant events in one area of the world can have an immediate and material adverse impact on markets around the world.", "Changes in international trade policy can also have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.", "Steps taken by governments to apply or consider applying tariffs on automobiles, parts, and other products and materials have the potential to disrupt existing supply chains, impose additional costs on our business, and may lead to other countries attempting to retaliate by imposing tariffs, which would make our products more expensive for customers, and, in turn, could make our products less competitive.", "In particular, China presents unique risks to U.S. automakers due to the strain in U.S.-China relations, China’s unique regulatory landscape, and the level of integration with key components in our global supply chain.", "Ford has operations in various markets with volatile economic or political environments.", "This may expose us to heightened risks as a result of economic, geopolitical, or other events, including governmental takeover (i.e., nationalization) of our manufacturing facilities or intellectual property, restrictive exchange or import controls, disruption of operations as a result of systemic political or economic instability, outbreak of war or expansion of hostilities (such as the actions taken by Russia in Ukraine), and acts of terrorism, each of which could impact our supply chain as well as our operations and have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.", "Further, the U.S. government, other governments, and international organizations could impose additional sanctions or export controls that could restrict us from doing business directly or indirectly in or with certain countries or parties, which could include affiliates.", "Industry sales volume can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis, recession, or significant geopolitical event.", "Because we, like other manufacturers, have a higher proportion of fixed structural costs, relatively small changes in industry sales volume can have a substantial effect on our cash flow and results of operations.", "Vehicle sales are affected by overall economic and market conditions and developing trends such as shared vehicle ownership and the transportation as a service model, e.g., ridesharing services.", "If industry vehicle sales were to decline to levels significantly below our planning assumption, the decline could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.", "For a discussion of economic trends, see Item 7.", "Ford may face increased price competition or a reduction in demand for its products resulting from industry excess capacity, currency fluctuations, competitive actions, or other factors.", "The global automotive industry is intensely competitive, with installed manufacturing capacity generally exceeding current demand.", "Historically, industry overcapacity has resulted in many manufacturers offering marketing incentives on vehicles in an attempt to maintain and grow market share; these incentives historically have included a combination of subsidized financing or leasing programs, price rebates, and other incentives.", "As a result, we are not necessarily able to set our prices to offset higher marketing incentives, commodity or other cost increases, tariffs, or the impact of adverse currency fluctuations.", "This risk includes cost advantages foreign competitors may have because of their weaker home market currencies, which may, in turn, enable those competitors to offer their products at lower prices.", "Further, higher inventory levels put downward pressure on pricing, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.", "As the automotive industry transitions to electric vehicles, excess capacity, particularly for internal combustion engine trucks and utilities, may continue or increase.", "This excess capacity may further increase price competition in that segment of the market, which could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.", "Inflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and market value of Ford or Ford Credit’s investments, including marketable securities, can have a significant effect on results.", "We and our suppliers are exposed to inflationary pressure and a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates.", "We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce potentially adverse effects on our business.", "Changes in commodity and energy prices (from tariffs and the actions taken by Russia in Ukraine, as discussed above under “With a global footprint, Ford’s results could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments, including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events,” or otherwise), currency exchange rates, and interest rates cannot always be predicted, hedged, or offset with price increases to eliminate earnings volatility.", "As a result, significant changes in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, or interest rates as well as increased material, freight, logistics, and similar costs could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.", "See Item 7 and Item 7A for additional discussion of currency, commodity and energy price, and interest rate risks.", "For example, interest rates have increased significantly as central banks in developed countries attempt to subdue inflation while government deficits and debt remain at high levels in many global markets.", "Accordingly, the eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt, tighter monetary policy, and potentially higher long-term interest rates may drive a higher cost of capital for the business.", "At Ford Credit, rising interest rates may impact Ford Credit’s ability to source funding and offer financing at competitive rates, which could reduce its financing margin.", "In addition, our results are impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments, with unrealized gains and losses that could be material in any period.", "Ford and Ford Credit’s access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors.", "Ford and Ford Credit’s ability to obtain unsecured funding at a reasonable cost is dependent on their credit ratings or their perceived creditworthiness.", "Further, Ford Credit’s ability to obtain securitized funding under its committed asset-backed liquidity programs and certain other asset-backed securitization transactions is subject to having a sufficient amount of assets eligible for these programs, as well as Ford Credit’s ability to obtain appropriate credit ratings and, for certain committed programs, derivatives to manage the interest rate risk.", "Over time, and particularly in the event of credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, or other factors, Ford Credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates because of funding constraints.", "In addition, Ford Credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates if there is a significant decline in the demand for the types of securities it offers or Ford Credit is unable to obtain derivatives to manage the interest rate risk associated with its securitization transactions.", "A significant reduction in the amount of receivables Ford Credit purchases or originates would significantly reduce its ongoing results of operations and could adversely affect its ability to support the sale of Ford vehicles.", "Furthermore, in addition to rising interest rates adversely affecting overall economic activity and the financial condition of our customers, increases in interest rates could cause credit market disruptions, which have historically resulted in higher borrower costs and made it more difficult to access the markets, obtain financing on favorable terms, and fund our operations.", "The impact of government incentives on Ford’s business could be significant, and Ford’s receipt of government incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback.", "We receive economic benefits from national, state, and local governments in various regions of the world in the form of incentives designed to encourage manufacturers to establish, maintain, or increase investment, workforce, or production.", "These incentives may take various forms, including grants, loan subsidies, or tax abatements or credits.", "The impact of these incentives can be significant in a particular market during a reporting period.", "A decrease in, expiration without renewal of, or other cessation or clawback of government incentives for any of our business units, as a result of administrative decision or otherwise, could have a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.", "Until 2021, most of our manufacturing facilities in South America were located in Brazil, where the state or federal governments historically offered significant incentives to manufacturers to encourage capital investment, increase manufacturing production, and create jobs.", "As a result, the performance of our South American operations had been impacted favorably by government incentives to a substantial extent.", "The federal government in Brazil has levied assessments against us concerning the federal incentives we previously received, and the State of São Paulo has challenged the grant to us of tax incentives by the State of Bahia.", "See Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for discussion of our accounting for government incentives, and “Item 3.", "Legal Proceedings” for a discussion of tax proceedings in Brazil and the potential requirement for us to post collateral.", "The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) provides, among other things, financial incentives in the form of tax credits to grow the domestic supply chain and domestic manufacturing base for electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), and other “clean” vehicles.", "The law likewise incentivizes the purchase of clean vehicles and the infrastructure to fuel them.", "These incentives are phasing in and will remain in effect until approximately 2032, unless modified by Congress.", "The IRA’s incentives are having and are expected to have material impacts on the automotive industry and Ford.", "The IRA authorizes tax credits to manufacturers for the domestic production of batteries and battery components for EVs and PHEVs and to purchasers of qualified commercial and retail clean vehicles.", "Ford expects that many customers will be able to monetize the commercial clean vehicle credit in light of Ford’s range of electrified product offerings for commercial applications.", "When paired with the IRA’s tax credit for the construction of certain electric vehicle charging infrastructure, Ford expects the commercial clean vehicle credit will significantly influence commercial fleets in their evaluation of a transition from internal combustion engine vehicles to EVs and PHEVs.", "To claim the retail tax credit, the IRA establishes numerous and complex prerequisites, including that the vehicle must be assembled in North America; the vehicle must be under specified limitations on manufacturer suggested retail price (“MSRP”); purchaser income limitations; starting in 2024, any vehicle that contains “battery components” that were “manufactured or assembled” by a “foreign entity of concern” will be ineligible; and, starting in 2025, any vehicle that contains battery materials that were “extracted, processed, or recycled” by a “foreign entity of concern” will be ineligible.", "A “Critical Minerals Credit” is available for those vehicles that have a specified percentage of critical minerals that are “extracted or produced” in the United States, in a country with which the United States has a Free Trade Agreement, or that is “recycled” in North America.", "A “Battery Components Credit” is available for those vehicles that have a specified percentage of “value” of its battery “components” that are “manufactured or assembled” in North America.", "Although we ultimately expect the IRA to benefit Ford and the automotive industry in general, the availability of such benefits will depend on the further development and improvement of the U.S. battery supply, sufficient access to raw materials within the scope of the IRA, and the terms of the regulations and guidance (and the limitations therein) the U.S. government issues to implement the IRA, which will ultimately determine which vehicles qualify for incentives and the amount thereof.", "For example, in late 2022 interim guidance was released on how to apply the MSRP limitations to the retail clean vehicle credit, and subjected a significant number of SUVs to a lower MSRP limitation than the industry expected, thereby excluding vehicles that may otherwise be eligible for the credit.", "Automakers that better optimize eligibility for their vehicles, as compared to their competition, will have a competitive advantage.", "Ford Credit could experience higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values, or higher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles.", "Credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer’s or dealer’s failure to make payments according to contract terms.", "Credit risk (which is heavily dependent upon economic factors including unemployment, consumer debt service burden, personal income growth, dealer profitability, and used car prices) has a significant impact on Ford Credit’s business.", "The level of credit losses Ford Credit may experience could exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations.", "In addition, Ford Credit projects expected residual values (including residual value support payments from Ford) and return volumes for the vehicles it leases.", "Actual proceeds realized by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned leased vehicles at lease termination may be lower than the amount projected, which would reduce Ford Credit’s return on the lease transaction.", "Among the factors that can affect the value of returned lease vehicles are the volume and mix of vehicles returned industry-wide, economic conditions, marketing programs, and quality or perceived quality, safety, fuel efficiency, or reliability of the vehicles, or changes in propulsion technology and related legislative changes.", "Actual return volumes may be influenced by these factors, as well as by contractual lease-end values relative to auction values.", "In 2022, Ford Credit experienced lower-than-expected return volumes.", "If auction values decrease significantly in the future, return volumes could exceed Ford Credit’s expectations.", "Each of these factors, alone or in combination, has the potential to adversely affect Ford Credit’s results of operations if actual results were to differ significantly from Ford Credit’s projections.", "See “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Item 7 for additional discussion.", "Economic and demographic experience for pension and OPEB plans (e.g., discount rates or investment returns) could be worse than Ford has assumed.", "The measurement of our obligations, costs, and liabilities associated with benefits pursuant to our pension and OPEB plans requires that we estimate the present value of projected future payments to all participants.", "We use many assumptions in calculating these estimates, including assumptions related to discount rates, investment returns on designated plan assets, and demographic experience (e.g., mortality and retirement rates).", "We generally remeasure these estimates at each year end and recognize any gains or losses associated with changes to our plan assets and liabilities in the year incurred.", "To the extent actual results are less favorable than our assumptions, we may", "recognize a remeasurement loss in our results, which could be substantial.", "For additional information regarding our assumptions, see “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Item 7 and Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.", "Pension and other postretirement liabilities could adversely affect Ford’s liquidity and financial condition.", "We have defined benefit retirement plans in the United States that cover many of our hourly and salaried employees.", "We also provide pension benefits to non-U.S. employees and retirees, primarily in Europe.", "In addition, we sponsor plans to provide OPEB for retired employees (primarily health care and life insurance benefits).", "See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information about these plans.", "These benefit plans impose significant liabilities on us and could require us to make additional cash contributions, which could impair our liquidity.", "If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to meet any pension or OPEB obligations, we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, suspend dividend payments, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness.", "Ford and Ford Credit could experience unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations, or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in products, services, perceived environmental impacts, or otherwise.", "We spend substantial resources to comply with governmental safety regulations, mobile and stationary source emissions regulations, consumer and automotive financial regulations, and other standards, but we cannot ensure that employees or other individuals affiliated with us will not violate such laws or regulations.", "In addition, as discussed below under “Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations” and “Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations, consumer protection regulations, or other regulations,” regulatory standards and interpretations may change on short notice and impact our compliance status.", "Government investigations against Ford or Ford Credit could result in fines, penalties, or orders that could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or the operation of our business.", "Moreover, compliance with governmental standards does not necessarily prevent individual or class action lawsuits, which can entail significant cost and risk.", "In certain circumstances, courts may permit civil actions even where our vehicles, services, and financial products comply with federal and/or other applicable law.", "Furthermore, simply responding to actual or threatened litigation or government investigations of our compliance with regulatory standards, whether related to our products, services, or business or commercial relationships, requires significant expenditures of time and other resources.", "Litigation also is inherently uncertain, and we could experience significant adverse results, including compensatory and punitive damage awards, a disgorgement of profits or revenue, or injunctive relief, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or our business in general.", "In addition, adverse publicity surrounding an allegation may cause significant reputational harm that could have a significant adverse effect on our sales.", "Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations.", "The automotive industry is subject to regulations worldwide that govern product characteristics and that differ by global region, country, and sometimes within national boundaries.", "Further, additional and new regulations continue to be proposed to address concerns regarding the environment (including concerns about global climate change and its impact), vehicle safety, and energy independence, and the regulatory landscape can change on short notice.", "These regulations vary, but generally require that over time motor vehicles and engines emit less air pollution, including greenhouse gas emissions, oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter.", "Similarly, we are making substantial investments in our facilities and revising our processes to not only comply with applicable regulations but also to make our operations more efficient and sustainable.", "As our suppliers make similar investments, those higher costs may be passed on to us.", "In the United States, legal and policy debates on environmental regulations are continuing, with a primary trend toward reducing GHG emissions and increasing vehicle electrification.", "Recently, different federal administrations have either sought to make standards more strict or to make them less strict, with one administration often replacing the regulations enacted by the last.", "Various third parties routinely seek judicial review of these federal regulatory and deregulatory efforts.", "In parallel, California continues to enact increasingly strict emissions standards and requirements for zero emission vehicles, and those actions are also the subject of legal challenges from third parties.", "Court rulings regarding regulatory actions by federal, California, and other state regulators create uncertainty and the potential for applicable regulatory standards to change quickly.", "In addition, many governments regulate local product content and/or impose import requirements with the aim of creating jobs, protecting domestic producers, and influencing the balance of payments.", "We are continuing to make changes to our product cycle plan to improve the fuel economy of our petroleum-powered vehicles and to offer more propulsion choices, such as electrified vehicles, with lower GHG emissions.", "Electrification is our core strategy to comply with current and anticipated environmental laws and regulations in major markets.", "However, there are limits on our ability to reduce emissions and increase fuel economy over a given time frame and many factors are involved that could delay or impede our plans, primarily relating to the cost and effectiveness of available technologies, consumer acceptance of new technologies and changes in vehicle mix (as described in more detail above under “Ford’s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries, and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced”), willingness of consumers to absorb the additional costs of new technologies, the appropriateness (or lack thereof) of certain technologies for use in particular vehicles, the widespread availability (or lack thereof) of supporting infrastructure for new technologies, including charging for electric vehicles, the availability (or lack thereof) of the raw materials and component supply to make batteries and other elements of electric vehicles, and the human, engineering, and financial resources necessary to deploy new technologies across a wide range of products and powertrains in a short time.", "If fuel prices are relatively low and market conditions do not drive consumers to purchase electric vehicles and other highly fuel-efficient vehicles in large numbers, it may be difficult to meet applicable environmental standards without compromising results.", "Moreover, a production disruption, stop ship, limited availability of necessary components, e.g., batteries or the raw materials necessary for their production, lower than planned market acceptance of our vehicles, or other intervening events may cause us to modify our product plans, or, in some cases, purchase credits, in order to comply with standards regarding fuel economy and air pollution, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and/or cause reputational harm.", "Increased scrutiny of automaker emission compliance by regulators around the world has led to new regulations, more stringent enforcement programs, additional field actions, demands for reporting on the field performance of emissions components and higher scrutiny of field data, and/or delays in regulatory approvals.", "The cost to comply with existing government regulations (in addition to the cost of any field service actions that may result from regulatory actions) is substantial and additional regulations, changes in regulatory interpretations, or changes in consumer preferences that affect vehicle mix, as well as a non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, could have a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.", "In addition, a number of governments, as well as non-governmental organizations, publicly assess vehicles to their own protocols.", "The protocols could change, and any negative perception regarding the performance of our vehicles subjected to such tests could reduce future sales.", "Court decisions arising out of consumer and investor litigation could give rise to de facto changes in the interpretation of existing emission laws and regulations, thereby imposing new burdens on manufacturers.", "For more discussion of the impact of standards on our global business, see the “Governmental Standards” discussion in “Item 1.", "Business” above.", "We and other companies continue to develop autonomous vehicle technologies, and the U.S. and foreign governments are continuing to develop the regulatory framework that will govern autonomous vehicles.", "The evolution of the regulatory framework for autonomous vehicles, and the pace of the development of such regulatory framework, may subject us to increased costs and uncertainty, and may ultimately impact our ability to deliver autonomous vehicles and related services that customers want.", "Ford and Ford Credit could be affected by the continued development of more stringent privacy, data use, and data protection laws and regulations as well as consumers’ heightened expectations to safeguard their personal information.", "We are subject to laws, rules,

Consumer Privacy Act) relating to the collection, use, cross-border data transfer, and security of personal information of consumers, employees, or others, including laws that may require us to notify regulators and affected individuals of a data security incident.", "Existing and newly developed laws and regulations may contain broad definitions of personal information, are subject to change and uncertain interpretations by courts and regulators, and may be inconsistent from state to state or country to country.", "Accordingly, complying with such laws and regulations may lead to a decline in consumer engagement or cause us to incur substantial costs to modify our operations or business practices.", "Moreover, regulatory actions seeking to impose significant financial penalties for noncompliance and/or legal actions (including pursuant to laws providing for private rights of action by consumers) could be brought against us in the event of a data compromise, misuse of consumer information, or perceived or actual non-compliance with data protection or privacy requirements.", "Further, any unauthorized release of personal information could harm our reputation, disrupt our business, cause us to expend significant resources, and lead to a loss of consumer confidence resulting in an adverse impact on our business and/or consumers deciding to withhold or withdraw consent for our collection or use of data.", "Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations, consumer protection regulations, or other regulations.", "As a finance company, Ford Credit is highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations in which it operates, which can impose significant additional costs and/or restrictions on its business.", "In the United States, for example, Ford Credit’s operations are subject to regulation and supervision under various federal, state, and local laws, including the federal Truth-in-Lending Act, Consumer Leasing Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and Fair Credit Reporting Act.", "The Dodd-Frank Act directs federal agencies to adopt rules to regulate the finance industry and the capital markets and gives the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) broad rule-making and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer financial protection laws that regulate consumer finance businesses, such as Ford Credit’s automotive financing business.", "Exercise of these powers by the CFPB may increase the costs of, impose additional restrictions on, or otherwise adversely affect companies in the automotive finance business.", "The CFPB has authority to supervise and examine the largest nonbank automotive finance companies, such as Ford Credit, for compliance with consumer financial protection laws.", "Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject Ford Credit to regulatory enforcement actions, including consent orders or similar orders where Ford Credit may be required to revise

evidence at the second trial to show that the roof design of the F-250 was not defective.", "During the second trial in August 2022, a jury found that Pep Boys (the party that sold the tires on the vehicle involved in the rollover accident) was responsible for 30% of the damages, and Ford, as a direct result of the sanctions order prohibiting Ford from presenting its defense, was responsible for 70% of the damages, resulting in $16.8 million in damages being apportioned to Ford.", "The jury subsequently awarded punitive damages against Ford in the amount of $1.7 billion.", "We have filed

line.", "In general, larger vehicles tend to command higher prices and be more profitable than smaller vehicles, both across and within vehicle segments.", "For example, in North America, our larger, more profitable vehicles had an average contribution margin that was 120% of our total average contribution margin across all vehicles, whereas our smaller vehicles had significantly lower contribution margins.", "In addition, government regulations aimed at reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency (e.g., ZEV mandates and low emission zones), and other factors that accelerate the transition to electrified vehicles, may increase the cost of vehicles by more than the perceived benefit to consumers and dampen margins.", "Trade Policy.", "To the extent governments in various regions implement or intensify barriers to imports, such as erecting tariff or non-tariff barriers or manipulating their currency, and provide advantages to local exporters selling into the global

have peaked, as gasoline and natural gas prices recede from the latest spike, core inflation (excluding food and energy prices) remains elevated and is a source of continued cost pressure on businesses and households.", "Interest rates have increased significantly as central banks in developed countries attempt to subdue inflation while government deficits and debt remain at high levels in many global markets.", "Accordingly, the eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt, tighter monetary policy, and potentially higher long-term interest rates may drive a higher cost of capital for the business.", "At Ford Credit, rising interest rates may impact its ability to source funding and offer financing at competitive rates, which could reduce its financing margin.", "Our Automotive segment revenue is generated primarily by sales of vehicles, parts, and accessories.", "Revenue is recorded when control is transferred to our customers (generally, our dealers and

Automotive wholesales are financed (primarily by Ford Credit) immediately upon the sale of vehicles to dealers, which generally occurs shortly after being produced.", "In contrast, our Automotive trade payables are based primarily on industry-standard production supplier payment terms of about 45 days.", "As a result, our cash flow deteriorates if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) decrease while trade payables continue to become due.", "Conversely, our cash flow improves if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) increase while new trade payables are generally not due for about 45 days.", "For example, the suspension of production at most of our assembly plants and lower industry volumes due to COVID-19 in early 2020 resulted in an initial deterioration of our cash flow, while the subsequent resumption of manufacturing operations and return to pre-COVID-19 production levels at most of our assembly plants resulted in a subsequent improvement of our cash flow.", "Even in normal economic conditions, however, these working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow.", "For example, we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables due to our annual summer and December shutdown periods when production, and therefore inventories and wholesale volumes, are usually at their lowest levels, while payables continue to come due and be paid.", "The net impact of this typically results in cash outflows from changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods.", "Our finished product inventory at December 31, 2022 was higher year over year due to production and release scheduling, which resulted in higher sales inventory, in-transit inventory, and units awaiting upfit.", "In response to, or in anticipation of, supplier disruptions, we may stockpile certain components or raw materials to help prevent disruption in our production of vehicles.", "Such actions could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory.", "Moreover, in order to secure critical materials for production of electric vehicles, we have entered into and plan to continue to enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers, including contributing up to $6.6 billion in capital to BlueOval SK, LLC over a five-year period ending in 2026.", "Such investments, which are part of our plan to invest over $50 billion in electric vehicles through 2026, could have an additional adverse impact on our cash in the near-term.", "The terms of the offtake agreements we have entered into, and those we may enter into in the future, vary by transaction, though they generally obligate us to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output produced by the counterparty over an agreed upon period of time.", "The purchase price mechanism included in the offtake agreement is typically based on the market price of the material at the time of delivery.", "The terms also may include conditions to our obligation to purchase the materials, such as quality or minimum output.", "Subject to satisfaction of those conditions, we will be obligated to purchase the materials at the cost determined by the purchase price mechanism.", "Based on the offtake agreements we have entered into thus far, the earliest date by which we could be obligated to purchase any output, subject to satisfaction of the applicable conditions, will be in 2024.", "Financial institutions participate in a supply chain finance (“SCF”) program that enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their Ford receivables (i.e.,

to the Financial Statements for more information regarding our foreign currency exchange contracts.", "Commodity Price Risk.", "Commodity price risk is the possibility that our financial results could be worse than planned because of changes in the prices of commodities used in the production of motor vehicles, such as base metals (e.g., steel, copper, and aluminum), precious metals (e.g., palladium), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene).", "As we transition to a greater mix of electric vehicles, we expect to increase our reliance on lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, among other materials, for batteries.", "Accordingly, our practice is to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk with respect to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we can economically hedge and consistent with our overall risk management strategy.", "In our hedging actions, we use derivative instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts).", "The extent to which we hedge is also impacted by our ability to achieve designated hedge accounting.",

in different magnitudes and at different times, and any changes in fair value would generally be offset by changes in the underlying exposure.", "In addition, our purchasing organization (with guidance from the GRMC, as appropriate) negotiates contracts for the continuous supply of raw materials.", "In some cases, these contracts stipulate minimum purchase amounts and specific prices, and, therefore, play a role in managing commodity price risk.", "Interest Rate Risk.", "Interest rate risk relates to the loss we could incur in our Company cash investment portfolios due to a change in interest rates.", "Our interest rate sensitivity analysis on the investment portfolios includes cash and cash equivalents and net marketable securities.", "At December 31, 2022, Company cash consisted of $0.2 billion of Rivian marketable securities and $32.1 billion of cash in our investment portfolios, compared to $10.6 billion of Rivian marketable securities and $26.0 billion of cash in our investment portfolios at December 31, 2021.", "We invest the portfolios in securities of various types and maturities, the value of which are subject to fluctuations in interest rates.", "The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short-term investments.", "In investing the cash in our investment portfolios, safety of principal is the primary objective and risk- adjusted return is the secondary objective.", "At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our portfolios.", "Assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our portfolios would be reduced by $256 million, as calculated as of December 31, 2022.", "This compares to $250 million, as calculated as of December 31, 2021.", "While these are our best estimates of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected.", "The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve.", "In reality, interest rate changes of this magnitude are rarely instantaneous or parallel.", "Market risk for Ford Credit is the possibility that changes in interest and currency exchange rates will adversely affect cash flow and economic value.", "Interest Rate Risk.", "Generally, Ford Credit’s assets and the related debt have different re-pricing periods, and consequently, respond differently to changes in interest rates.", "Ford Credit’s assets consist primarily of fixed-rate retail financing and operating lease contracts and floating-rate wholesale receivables.", "Fixed-rate retail financing and operating lease contracts generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract.", "Wholesale receivables are originated to finance new and used vehicles held in dealers’ inventory and generally require dealers to pay a floating rate.", "Debt consists primarily of short- and long-term unsecured and securitized debt.", "Ford Credit’s term debt instruments are principally fixed-rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity.", "Ford Credit’s interest rate risk management objective is to reduce volatility in its cash flows and volatility in its economic value from changes in interest rates based on an established risk tolerance that may vary by market.", "Ford Credit uses economic value sensitivity analysis and re-pricing gap analysis to evaluate potential long-term effects of changes in interest rates.", "It then enters into interest rate swaps to convert portions of its floating-rate debt to fixed or its fixed-rate debt to floating to ensure that Ford Credit’s exposure falls within the established tolerances.", "Ford Credit also uses pre-tax cash flow sensitivity analysis to monitor the level of near-term cash flow exposure.", "The pre-tax cash flow sensitivity analysis measures the changes in expected cash flows associated with Ford Credit’s interest-rate-sensitive assets, liabilities, and derivative financial instruments from hypothetical changes in interest rates over a twelve-month horizon.", "Interest rate swaps are placed to maintain exposure within approved thresholds and the Asset-Liability Committee reviews the re-pricing mismatch monthly.", "To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its pre-tax cash flow to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease of one percentage point in all interest rates across all maturities (a “parallel shift”), as well as a base case that assumes that all interest rates remain constant at existing levels.", "In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in Ford Credit’s analysis.", "As a result, the actual impact to pre-tax cash flow could be higher or lower than the results detailed in the table below.", "These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent Ford Credit’s view of future interest rate movements.", "Under these interest rate scenarios, Ford Credit expects more assets than debt and liabilities to re-price in the next twelve months.", "Other things being equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest received on Ford Credit’s assets will increase more than the interest paid on Ford Credit’s debt, thereby initially increasing Ford Credit’s pre-tax cash flow.", "During a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credit would expect its pre-tax cash flow to initially decrease.", "Ford Credit’s pre-tax cash flow sensitivity to interest rate movement at December 31 was as follows (in millions):", "One percentage point instantaneous increase in interest rates", "One percentage point instantaneous decrease in interest rates (a)", "(a) Pre-tax cash flow sensitivity given a one percentage point decrease in interest rates requires an assumption of negative interest rates in markets where existing interest rates are below one percent.", "While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credit’s best estimate of the impacts of the specified assumed interest rate scenarios, its actual results could differ from those projected.", "The model Ford Credit uses to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions.", "Embedded in the model are assumptions regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, replacement of maturing derivatives, exercise of options embedded in debt and derivatives, and predicted repayment of retail financing and operating lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity.", "Ford Credit’s repayment projections ahead of contractual maturity are based on historical experience.", "If interest rates or other factors change, Ford Credit’s actual prepayment experience could be different than projected.", "Item 7A.", "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued)", "Foreign Currency Risk.", "Ford Credit’s policy is to minimize exposure to changes in currency exchange rates.", "To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit borrows in a variety of currencies, principally U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, euros, sterling, and renminbi.", "Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables.", "When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements.", "When a different currency is used, Ford Credit may use foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards to convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables.", "As a result of this policy, Ford Credit believes its market risk exposure, relating to changes in currency exchange rates at December 31, 2022, is insignificant.", "Derivative Fair Values.", "The net fair value of Ford Credit’s derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2022 was a liability of $2.0 billion, compared to an asset of $553 million at December 31, 2021.", "The decline in net fair value was driven by higher U.S. interest rates and a stronger U.S. dollar.", "Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract.", "We enter into master agreements with counterparties that allow netting of certain exposures in order to manage this risk.", "Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, and commodity price risk.", "We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification.", "Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward-looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions before risks become losses.", "Exposure limits are established based on our overall risk tolerance, which is calculated from counterparty credit ratings and market-based credit default swap (“CDS”) spreads.", "The exposure limits are lower for smaller and lower-rated counterparties, counterparties that have relatively higher CDS spreads, and for longer dated exposures.", "Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and included in periodic reports to our Treasurer.", "Substantially all of

issued by the COSO.", "As discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for credit losses in 2020.", "The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.", "Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated

Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.", "We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.", "Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.", "Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.", "Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.", "Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as

of Internal Control over Financial Reporting", "A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial

includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.", "Because of its inherent

consumer allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of the lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the consumer finance receivables as of the balance sheet date.", "For consumer receivables that share similar risk characteristics, management estimates the lifetime expected credit losses based on a collective assessment using measurement models and management judgment.", "The lifetime expected credit losses for the receivables is determined by applying probability of default and loss given default assumptions to monthly expected exposures, then discounting these cash flows to present value using the receivable’s original effective interest rate or the current effective interest rate for a variable rate receivable.", "If management does not believe the models reflect lifetime expected credit losses for the portfolio, an adjustment is made to reflect management judgment regarding qualitative factors including economic uncertainty, observable changes in portfolio performance, and other relevant factors.", "The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Ford Credit consumer finance receivables allowance for credit losses is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in determining the consumer finance receivables allowance for credit losses; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the probability of default and loss given default assumptions and management’s judgment regarding qualitative factors; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.", "Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.", "These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s determination of the consumer finance receivables allowance for credit losses.", "These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for determining the consumer finance receivables allowance

service action obligations using a patterned estimation model, using historical information regarding the nature, frequency, severity, and average cost of claims for each model year.", "Management reevaluates the adequacy of their accruals on a regular basis.", "The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the warranty accrual for the United States is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in the estimation of the accrual and development of the patterned estimation model; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the estimation model and significant assumptions related to the frequency and average cost of claims; and (iii) the audit effort

adopted ambient health-based standards, EPA and CARB also regulate greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions from vehicles.", "As of December 31, 2023, seventeen states (referenced as “opt-in” states) have adopted CARB’s light-duty emissions standards, and nine opt-in states have adopted California’s heavy-duty standards.", "The list of opt-in states changes over time, based on the legislative and regulatory actions by each individual state.", "Both federal and California regulations also require motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines to be equipped with on-board diagnostic (“OBD”) systems that monitor emission-related systems and components.", "Light- and medium-duty vehicles and heavy-duty engines or vehicles must be certified by EPA prior to sale in the United States and by CARB prior to sale in California and the relevant opt-in states.", "Canada accepts EPA certification.", "Compliance with emissions standards, OBD requirements, and related regulations can be challenging and can drive increased product development costs, higher retail prices, warranty costs, and vehicle recalls.", "For light- and medium-duty passenger cars and light trucks, EPA promulgated a rule in 2021 establishing GHG standards applicable from model years 2023 through 2026.", "This rule reversed a rollback of GHG standards that EPA had previously promulgated in 2020.", "The 2021 rule is the subject of a pending legal challenge, with a court decision expected in 2024.", "In 2023, EPA proposed more stringent standards regulating GHG emissions and criteria pollutants—with other updates to durability, warranty, and OBD requirements—for light- and medium-duty vehicles that would phase in from model years 2027 through 2032.", "These standards are expected to be finalized in the first half of 2024.", "The new regulations are expected to be substantially more stringent than current standards, and are intended to drive a significant increase in electric vehicle sales mix along with emissions reductions from internal combustion vehicles.", "The EPA rules are therefore expected to impose increased challenges and costs for light-duty vehicle manufacturers, including Ford.", "In 2019, EPA revoked California’s authority to set and enforce its own vehicle GHG standards that apply through model year 2025, together with the authority of the opt-in states to implement California’s standards.", "During this time, Ford reached an agreement with California on a set of terms for an alternative framework in which Ford committed to meet a designated set of standards on a national basis for model years 2021 through 2026 that were more stringent than the then-rolled back federal standards in lieu of the California regulatory program.", "This framework enabled Ford to continue its product planning on a nationwide basis.", "EPA’s 2021 rule established GHG standards that are more stringent than this California framework agreement.", "Further, in 2022, EPA reversed the 2019 revocation of California’s authority to set and enforce its own vehicle GHG standards.", "That reversal is also the subject of a legal challenge, with a court decision expected in 2024.", "In 2022, CARB adopted new light-duty emissions standards applicable to vehicles beginning in model year 2026 as part of its new Advanced Clean Cars II (“ACC II”) regulations.", "ACC II includes more stringent emissions standards and other new emissions requirements, with the stated goal of 100% electrification of new passenger cars and trucks by 2035.", "EPA has yet to take final action on CARB’s request for a waiver of federal preemption for the ACC II standards, which will be necessary before they can be enforced.", "The expected court ruling in the legal challenge to EPA’s reversal of the revocation of California’s authority could also impact EPA’s action on CARB’s request for a waiver of preemption for ACC II.", "CARB has also adopted new emissions regulations applicable to model year 2024 and later heavy-duty engines, as well as extended heavy-duty warranty requirements beginning with model year 2022.", "EPA has granted waivers of preemption for some of CARB’s heavy-duty standards, and is expected to grant or deny waivers for the remaining standards in 2024 (agency action which could be impacted by the outcome of the litigation over the waiver for CARB’s light-duty standards).", "EPA itself has adopted more stringent heavy-duty criteria emissions standards, beginning with the 2027 model year, and proposed more stringent heavy-duty GHG emissions standards, also beginning with the 2027 model year, which are expected to be finalized in the first half of 2024.", "These rules include more stringent emissions standards, as well as new requirements affecting durability testing, warranty, and OBD.", "In Ford’s case, the heavy-duty emissions standards—as well as the fuel economy standards discussed below—primarily affect heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans, as well as vocational vehicles such as shuttle buses and delivery trucks.", "As the heavy-duty standards increase in stringency, it may become more difficult to comply while continuing to offer a full lineup of heavy-duty trucks.", "The new rules promulgated by EPA and CARB are expected to impose increased challenges and costs on Ford and other manufacturers of light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles and engines.", "Stringent federal or state agency fuel economy and GHG standards that are misaligned with market conditions could also force Ford to take various actions that could have substantial adverse effects on its sales volumes and operations.", "Such actions could include restricting offerings of selected engines and popular options; taking actions to increase sales of Ford’s most fuel-efficient vehicles; and ultimately curtailing the production and sale of certain internal combustion vehicles, such as high-performance cars, utility vehicles, and/or full- size light trucks in order to maintain compliance.", "The ongoing litigation challenging EPA and CARB standards and potential future federal reversals and rollbacks create risks for Ford’s planning and investing for compliance, or could also potentially relieve the burdens of misalignment of the standards with market conditions.", "Compliance with automobile emissions standards depends in part on the widespread availability of high-quality and consistent automotive fuels that the vehicles were designed to use.", "Legislative, regulatory, and judicial developments related to fuel quality at both the national and state levels could affect vehicle manufacturers’ warranty costs as well as their ability to comply with vehicle emissions standards.", "California ZEV Requirements.", "The California vehicle emissions program includes requirements for manufacturers to produce and deliver for sale zero-emission vehicles (“ZEVs”).", "California’s light-duty vehicle ZEV regulation, which uses a system based on credits that can be banked and carried forward, mandates annual increases in the production and sale of battery-electric, fuel cell, and plug-in hybrid vehicles.", "By model year 2025, this regulation will require approximately 22% of a manufacturer’s California light-duty vehicle sales volume be ZEVs.", "In ACC II, California has revised the ZEV regulation in a way that will continue to increase ZEV sales.", "Beginning with model year 2026, the revised ZEV rule mandates a 35% light- duty ZEV sales requirement, rising to 100% by 2035.", "The revised regulation also imposes significant restrictions on credit usage and new requirements for EV battery durability.", "EPA must either decide that these revisions fall within the scope of prior waivers of federal preemption granted for CARB’s ZEV amendments or waive preemption for these standards before the standards can be enforced.", "Also, California has instituted ZEV regulations governing medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, beginning with the 2024 model year.", "These stringent ZEV requirements covering light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles could yield significant costs and compliance challenges, and include complex warranty and recall requirements.", "As of December 31, 2023, sixteen states have adopted California’s ZEV requirements.", "Additionally, in 2023, California adopted new medium- and heavy-duty fleet purchase requirements that include a 100% ZEV manufacturer sales requirement starting in 2036.", "Compliance with ZEV requirements depends on market conditions (including consumer preference for and the pricing of EVs) in each jurisdiction where the requirements apply (such as California and each opt-in state), technology readiness, and battery raw material availability as well as the availability of adequate infrastructure to support vehicle charging.", "Federal Fuel Economy Requirements - Light-Duty Vehicles.", "Federal law requires that light-duty vehicles meet minimum corporate average fuel economy (“CAFE”) standards set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”).", "Manufacturers are subject to civil penalties if they fail to meet the CAFE standard in any model year, after taking into account all available credits for the preceding five model years and expected credits for the three succeeding model years.", "The law", "requires NHTSA to promulgate and enforce separate CAFE standards applicable to each manufacturer’s fleet of domestic passenger cars, imported passenger cars, and light-duty trucks.", "Because the vast majority of GHGs emitted by a vehicle are the result of fuel combustion, GHG emissions correspond closely with fuel economy.", "Historically, NHTSA and EPA have therefore coordinated with each other on their fuel economy and GHG standards, respectively, to avoid potential inconsistencies.", "Beginning with the 2012 model year, EPA and NHTSA jointly promulgated harmonized GHG and fuel economy regulations under what came to be known as the “One National Program” (“ONP”) framework, and California agreed that compliance with the federal program would satisfy compliance with its own GHG requirements, thereby avoiding a patchwork of federal and state standards.", "In 2022, NHTSA finalized more stringent fuel economy standards for model years 2024-2026, which are substantially aligned with EPA’s GHG standards.", "These standards are subject to a legal challenge, with a court decision expected in 2024.", "In 2023, NHTSA proposed increasingly stringent fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks in model years 2027-2031 and heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans in model years 2030 through 2035.", "NHTSA proposed these fuel economy standards separately from EPA’s proposed GHG standards for the same model years, and it is not clear whether the NHTSA and EPA standards will be aligned, or whether they will be aligned with CARB’s ACC II standards.", "Different standards pose additional compliance burdens, including complexity and costs.", "European Emissions Standards.", "EU and U.K. regulations, directives, and related legislation limit the amount of regulated pollutants that may be emitted by new motor vehicles and engines sold in the European Union and the United Kingdom.", "Regulatory stringency has increased significantly with the application of Stage VI emission standards (first introduced in 2014) and the implementation of a laboratory test cycle for CO2 and emissions and the introduction of on-road emission testing using portable emission analyzers (Real Driving Emission or “RDE”).", "These on-road emission tests are in addition to the laboratory-based tests (first introduced in 2017).", "The divergence between the regulatory limit that is tested in laboratory conditions and the allowed values measured in RDE tests will ultimately be reduced to zero as the regulatory demands increase.", "In addition, new requirements for tailpipe and non-tailpipe emissions will be included in the upcoming Euro 7 regulation.", "The costs associated with complying with all of these requirements are significant, and following the EU Commission’s indication of its intent to accelerate emissions rules in its road map publication “EU Green Deal” as well as the EU sustainable mobility action plan, these challenges will continue in European markets, including the United Kingdom.", "In addition, the Whole Vehicle Type Approval (“WVTA”) regulation has been updated to increase the stringency of in-market surveillance.", "Moreover, following the U.K.’s withdrawal from the European Union, we may be subject to diverging requirements in our European markets, which could increase vehicle complexity and duties.", "There is an increasing trend of city access restrictions for internal combustion engine powered vehicles.", "The access rules being introduced are developed by individual cities based on their specific concerns, resulting in rapid deployment of access rules that differ greatly among cities.", "The speed of implementation of access rules may directly influence customer vehicle residual values and choice of next purchase.", "In an effort to support the Paris Accord, some countries are adopting yearly increases in CO2 taxes, where such a system is in place, and publishing dates by when internal combustion powered vehicles may no longer be registered, e.g., Norway in 2025 and the Netherlands in 2030.", "Other National Emissions Control Requirements.", "Many countries, in an effort to address air quality and climate change concerns, are adopting previous versions of European or United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (“UN-ECE”) mobile source emission regulations.", "Some countries have adopted more advanced regulations based on the most recent version of European or U.S. regulations.", "For example, the China Stage VI light-duty vehicle emission standards, based on European Stage VI emission standards for light-duty vehicles, U.S. evaporative and refueling emissions standards, and CARB OBD II requirements, incorporate two levels of stringency for tailpipe emissions.", "Under the level one (VI(a)) standard, the emissions limits are comparable to the EU Stage VI limits, except for carbon monoxide, which is 30% lower than the EU Stage VI limit.", "The more stringent level two (VI(b)) standard’s emissions limits, which are currently in place nationwide in China, are approximately 30-50% lower than the EU Stage VI limits, depending on the pollutants.", "Both China Stage VII light- duty vehicles and heavy-duty vehicles emission regulations are expected to be drafted between 2024 and 2025, and the Ministry of Ecology and Environment has advised that the Stage VII regulations will have more stringent limits on pollutant emissions and will establish limits for greenhouse gas (primarily CO2) tailpipe emissions.", "Mexico and most countries in Central America, the Caribbean, and South America are evolving to implement more stringent requirements accepting Europe and U.S. regulations, except Brazil, which has a unique local process called PROCONVE based on U.S. regulations for light-duty vehicles and European regulations for heavy-duty vehicles.", "Other countries across Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Australasia expect to introduce regulations based on EU Stage VI standards in the near term.", "Canadian criteria emissions regulations are largely aligned with U.S. requirements and are anticipated to remain aligned with the new EPA rules that will be published in 2024 for 2027 model year and beyond.", "Elsewhere, there is a mix of regulations and processes based on U.S. and EU standards.", "Not all countries have adopted appropriate fuel quality standards to accompany the stringent emission standards adopted.", "This could lead to compliance problems, particularly if OBD or in-use surveillance requirements are implemented.", "Global Developments.", "Vehicle emissions regulators continue to focus on the use of “defeat devices.” Defeat devices are elements of design (typically embedded in software) that improperly cause the emission control system to function less effectively during normal on-road driving than during an official laboratory emissions test, without justification.", "They are prohibited by law in many jurisdictions, and we do not use defeat devices in our vehicles.", "Regulators around the world continue to scrutinize automakers’ emission testing, which has led to a number of defeat device settlements by various manufacturers.", "EPA is carrying out additional non-standard tests as part of its vehicle certification program.", "CARB has also been conducting extensive non-standard emission tests, which in some cases have resulted in certification delays for diesel vehicles.", "In the past, several European countries have conducted non-standard emission tests and published the results, and, in some cases, this supplemental testing has triggered investigations of manufacturers for possible defeat devices.", "Testing is expected to continue on an ongoing basis.", "In addition, plaintiffs’ attorneys are pursuing consumer class action lawsuits based on alleged excessive emissions from cars and trucks, which could, in turn, prompt further investigations by regulators.", "European GHG Requirements.", "The European Union regulates passenger car and light commercial vehicle CO2 emissions using sliding scales with different CO2 targets for each manufacturer based on the respective average vehicle weight for its fleet of vehicles first registered in a calendar year, with separate targets for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.", "A penalty system applies to manufacturers failing to meet the individual CO2 targets.", "Pooling agreements between manufacturers to utilize credits are possible under certain conditions, and we have entered into such pooling agreements in order to comply with fuel economy regulations without paying a penalty and to enable other manufacturers to benefit from our positive CO2 performance.", "For “multi-stage vehicles” (e.g., Ford’s Transit chassis cabs), the base manufacturer (e.g., Ford) is fully responsible for the CO2 performance of the final up-fitted vehicles.", "The initial target levels get significantly more stringent every five years (2025, 2030, and 2035, after which all new light-duty vehicles must be zero emission), requiring significant investments in propulsion technologies and extensive fleet management to enable low CO2 emissions for our fleet.", "EU heavy-duty CO2 regulations are being finalized and will also limit CO2 fleet performance, with slightly different requirements.", "The United Kingdom and Switzerland have introduced similar rules for light-duty vehicles, and the United Kingdom has adopted ZEV mandates as well as CO2 fleet limits for non-ZEV vehicles starting in 2024.", "The EU Commission is investigating the introduction of Real Driving CO2 and Life Cycle Assessment elements, and heavy-duty vehicles are addressed in separate regulations with analogous requirements and challenges.", "As discussed above, the EU Commission has announced a “Green Deal” with more stringent requirements for CO2 emissions (including stricter CO2 fleet regulations) and other regulated emissions and include recycling and substance restrictions.", "While the EU Commission targets net climate neutrality by 2050 and an ambitious 2030 interim target (a 55% CO2 reduction across all industries compared to 1990), several countries, such as Germany, have adopted stricter interim targets and earlier net climate neutrality targets.", "Ford also faces the risk of advance premium payments for both passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in all European markets due to, for example, unexpected market fluctuations and shorter lead times impacting average fleet performance.", "The United Nations developed a technical regulation for passenger car emissions and CO2.", "This world light-duty test procedure (“WLTP”) is focused primarily on better aligning laboratory CO2 and fuel consumption figures with customer- reported figures.", "The introduction of WLTP in Europe started in September 2017 and requires updates to CO2 labeling, thereby impacting taxes in countries with a CO2 tax scheme as well as CO2 fleet regulations for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.", "Costs associated with new or incremental testing for WLTP are significant.", "Some European countries have implemented or are considering other initiatives for reducing CO2 vehicle emissions, including fiscal measures and CO2 labeling to address country specific targets associated with the Paris Accord.", "For example, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands, among others, have introduced taxation based on CO2 emissions.", "The EU CO2 requirements are likely to trigger further measures.", "In addition, delayed vehicle launches and supply shortages, as well as an insufficient charging infrastructure and lower demand for ZEV and low", "In addition to imposing strict emissions requirements, European regulations are increasingly including other sustainability requirements, such as reporting obligations and supply chain due diligence.", "While these regulations are applicable in European jurisdictions, they often apply to global corporations and require adjustments in corporate processes, policies, and strategies, which may be costly.", "For example, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive requires companies to disclose how their business model and strategy align with limiting global warming to 1.5°C in line with the Paris Agreement.", "Companies that fail to comply with these requirements could face significant monetary penalties and suffer reputational harm.", "In 2023, the EU adopted the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (“CBAM”), which will subject certain imported materials (such as iron, steel, and aluminum) to a carbon levy linked to the carbon price payable on domestic goods under the European Trading Scheme.", "The CBAM could increase our costs of importing such materials and/or limit our ability to import lower cost materials from non-EU countries.", "Other National GHG and Fuel Economy Requirements.", "Regional governments across the globe are considering implementing, and in some cases introducing, emissions regulations that align with CAFE standards.", "The Canadian federal government regulates vehicle GHG emissions under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.", "In October 2014, the Canadian federal government published the final changes to the regulation for light-duty vehicles, which maintain alignment with U.S. EPA vehicle GHG standards for the 2017-2025 model years.", "The revised U.S. EPA standards were automatically adopted in Canada by reference for the 2022-2026 model years, and draft amendments for a few standalone administrative elements not automatically adopted by reference were published in December 2022.", "The heavy-duty vehicle and engine GHG emissions regulations for the 2021 model year and beyond were published in May 2018 and are in line with U.S. requirements, subject to any change in those requirements.", "Ford expects that the federal government in Canada will continue to align its standards with the new EPA standards for the 2027 model year and beyond.", "On December 20, 2023, the Canadian federal government also published light-duty ZEV sales requirements through amendments to the Passenger Automobile and Light Truck Greenhouse Gas Emission Regulations.", "The amendments require annual sales percentages starting with 20% for the 2026 model year to 100% by the 2035 model year.", "The federal government has also published its intent to develop ZEV sales requirements for heavy-duty vehicles beginning with the 2027 model year.", "Both Quebec and British Columbia have regulations requiring that 100% of new vehicle sales be ZEVs by 2035, but finalized amendments in 2023 that increase their interim annual targets starting in 2025 and 2026.", "Both provinces have also started developing", "heavy-duty ZEV mandates based on CARB’s standards.", "Compliance with ZEV requirements depends heavily on market conditions that promote consumer preference for EVs, such as technology readiness, purchase incentives, and affordability, as well as the availability and reliability of adequate infrastructure to support vehicle charging.", "In addition to the ZEV mandates, Quebec is also developing a regulation to ban the sale of light-duty internal combustion engine vehicles as of 2035, which is intended to capture only small manufacturers not already obligated under the ZEV mandate.", "Other provinces have signaled their interest in light-duty ZEV sales regulations but are waiting to assess the provincial impact of the final federal ZEV regulations.", "China’s Corporate Average Fuel Consumption and New Energy Vehicle (“NEV”) Credit Administrative Rules contain fuel consumption requirements as well as credit mandates for NEV passenger vehicles, i.e., plug-in hybrids, electric vehicles, or fuel cell vehicles.", "The fuel consumption requirement uses a weight-based approach to establish targets, with year-over-year target reductions.", "China set a target of 4.6L/100km for the 2025 passenger vehicle industry fuel consumption fleet average and is projecting a further fuel consumption reduction to a target of 3.5L/100km in 2030, based on the WLTP.", "The NEV mandate requires that OEMs generate a specific amount of NEV credits each year, with NEV credits of at least 28% and 38% of the annual ICE passenger vehicle production or import volumes required in 2024 and 2025, respectively.", "Future percentages are currently proposed as 45%, 50%, and 54% of the annual ICE plus NEV passenger vehicles production or import volumes for 2026, 2027, and 2028, respectively.", "Demand for EVs continues to grow, at fluctuating rates.", "As discussed below in Item 1A.", "Risk Factors under “Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations,” in addition to the rates of EV growth, production disruptions, stop ships, supply chain limitations, lower-than-planned market acceptance of our vehicles, and/or other circumstances may cause us to modify product plans or, in some cases, purchase credits in order to comply with emissions standards, fuel economy standards, or ZEV requirements.", "In the fourth quarter of 2023, for example, we entered into an agreement to purchase about $700 million of regulatory compliance credits for future use in the United States, the ultimate number of which is dependent on the seller’s ability to deliver the credits.", "U.S.", "Requirements.", "The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the “Safety Act”) regulates vehicles and vehicle equipment in two primary ways.", "First, the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA.", "Meeting or exceeding many safety standards is costly and has continued to evolve as global compliance requirements and public domain (e.g., New Car Assessment Programs (“NCAPs”), Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (“IIHS”), and the China Insurance Auto Safety Index) ratings and assessments continue to evolve, are increasing in demands, and lack harmonization globally.", "As we expand our business priorities to include autonomous vehicle technologies and broader mobility products and services, our financial exposure has increased.", "Similarly, federal and state regulatory requirements are growing quickly as lawmakers and regulators adapt to advancements in automation, ranging from driver-assistance technologies such as automatic braking to fully autonomous vehicles.", "Second, the Safety Act requires that defects related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns.", "A manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it or NHTSA determines the vehicles contain a non- compliance or a defect resulting in an unreasonable risk to safety.", "Should we or NHTSA determine that either a safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.", "European Requirements.", "The EU has established vehicle safety standards and regulations and is likely to adopt additional or more stringent requirements in the future, especially in the areas of access to in-vehicle data, artificial intelligence, and autonomous vehicle technologies.", "The European General Safety Regulation (“GSR”) introduced UN-ECE regulations, which are required for the European Type Approval process.", "The GSR includes the mandatory introduction of multiple active and passive safety features, including cybersecurity requirements for new vehicle models from 2022 and for all registrations in 2024.", "EU regulators are focusing on active safety features, such as lane departure warning systems, electronic stability control, and automatic brake assist.", "Furthermore, mobile network providers in certain EU Member States have begun shutting down their 2G and 3G networks, which form the basis for e-Call system functionality in existing vehicles.", "The e-Call systems in existing vehicles may need to be updated as these systems are phased out.", "It is also possible that the EU may mandate Member States to maintain these networks to allow for the continued functionality of existing e-Call systems.", "Other National Requirements.", "Globally, governments generally have been adopting UN-ECE based regulations with minor variations to address local concerns.", "Any difference between North American and UN-ECE based regulations can add complexity and costs to the development of global platform vehicles, and we continue to support efforts to harmonize regulations to reduce vehicle design complexity while providing a common level of safety performance; we are seeking new opportunities in bilateral negotiations that can potentially contribute to this goal.", "Safety and recall requirements in Brazil, China, India, South Korea, and Gulf Cooperation Council (“GCC”) countries may add substantial costs and complexity to our global recall practice.", "Brazil has set mandatory fleet safety targets and penalties are applied if these levels are not maintained, while a tax reduction may be available for over-performance.", "In Canada, regulatory requirements are currently aligned with U.S. regulations; however, under the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Act, the Minister of Transport has broad powers to

from their suppliers.", "If there is a shortage of a key component in our supply chain or a supplier is unable to deliver a component to us in accordance with our specifications, because of a production issue, limited availability of materials, shipping problems, restrictions on transactions with certain countries or companies, or other reason, and the component cannot be easily sourced from a different supplier, or we are unable to obtain a component on a timely basis, the shortage may disrupt our operations or increase our costs of production.", "For the production of our electric

improve quality, we have slowed down and may continue to slow down launches, which may result in lost sales, revenue, and profits and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.", "In addition, as a result of vehicles on hold for quality control, our inventory levels may be higher.", "Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions, divestitures, or business strategies.", "We have invested in, formed strategic alliances with, and announced or formed joint ventures with a number of companies, and we may expand those relationships or enter into similar relationships with additional companies.", "These initiatives typically involve enormous complexity, may require a significant amount of capital, and may involve a lengthy regulatory approval process.", "As a result, we may not be able to complete anticipated transactions, the anticipated benefits of these transactions may not be realized, or the benefits may be delayed.", "For example, we may not successfully integrate an alliance or joint venture with our operations, including the implementation of our controls, systems, procedures, and policies, or unforeseen expenses or liabilities may arise that were not discovered during due diligence prior to an investment or entry into a strategic alliance, or a misalignment of interests may develop between us and the other party.", "Further, to the extent we share ownership, control, or management with another party in a joint venture, our ability to influence the joint venture may be limited, and we may be unable to prevent misconduct or implement our compliance or internal control systems.", "In order to secure critical materials for production of electric vehicles, we have entered into and may, in the future, enter into offtake agreements and other long-term purchase contracts with raw materials suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers; however, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these actions and our efforts to have such suppliers, particularly those in less developed markets, adopt Ford’s sustainability and other standards may be unsuccessful, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation.", "In addition, the implementation of a new or different business strategy may lead to the disruption of our existing business operations, including distracting management from current operations.", "For example, our efforts to evaluate and implement alternative distribution models and channels for our products and services from those we have traditionally used may be challenged or may not succeed or be as successful as our historical arrangements.", "External factors may also impact the success of our initiatives.", "For example, our business and strategy are susceptible to tensions in U.S.-China relations and the rapid development of the Chinese electric vehicle industry, with domestic Chinese producers exporting to some key markets in which we operate.", "In addition, as we transition to producing a higher percentage of electric vehicles, if industrywide adoption rates continue to be lower than anticipated, we may take actions to better match the pace of electric vehicle adoption, such as not fully utilizing or reducing the capacity of our existing or future plants, reducing production hours or shifts, and we may become subject to claims by suppliers as a result.", "Results of operations from new activities may be lower than our existing activities, and, if a strategy is unsuccessful, we may not recoup our investments, which may be significant, in that strategy.", "Moreover, we may continue to have financial exposure following a strategic divestiture or cessation of operations in a market.", "Failure to successfully and timely realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions or strategies described herein could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.", "Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of restructuring actions and such actions may cause Ford to incur significant charges, disrupt our operations, or harm our reputation.", "We continually review and evaluate our business to find opportunities to make our operations more efficient and reduce costs.", "In doing so, we have taken and may in the future take restructuring actions, such as strategic divestitures or ceasing of operations in a market, particularly for those businesses where a path to sustained profitability is not feasible in light of the capital allocation requirements or for other reasons.", "Our plans for implementing such actions may be accelerated by shifting industry dynamics and new entrants to our industries with which we must compete.", "These actions may include employee separations, a reduced footprint (e.g., plant closures or smaller operations at existing plants or plants that are not yet on-line), or operating our plants at less than full capacity (e.g., reducing shifts).", "Such restructuring actions have caused us and may in the future cause us to incur significant costs; record impairments or other charges; subject us to potential claims from employees, suppliers, dealers, other counterparties, or governmental authorities (including a reduction or clawback of incentives); disrupt our operations; distract management from current operations; or harm our reputation.", "Further, we may not realize the expected benefits of such restructuring actions (e.g., anticipated cost savings), such benefits may be delayed, or market dynamics or other factors may have evolved such that we cannot obtain the original intended results of an action.", "Operational information systems, security systems, vehicles, and services could be affected by cybersecurity incidents, ransomware attacks, and other disruptions and impact Ford and Ford Credit as well as their suppliers and dealers.", "We rely on information technology networks and information systems, including in-vehicle systems and mobile devices, some of which are managed by suppliers, to process, transmit, and store electronic information that is important to the operation of our business, our vehicles, and the services we offer.", "Despite devoting significant resources to our cybersecurity program, we are at risk for interruptions, outages, and compromises of: (i) operational information systems (including business, financial, accounting, product development, consumer receivables, data processing, or manufacturing processes); (ii) facility security systems; and/or (iii) in-vehicle systems or mobile devices, whether caused by a ransomware or other cybersecurity incident, security breach, or other reason (e.g., a natural disaster, fire, acts of terrorism or war, or an overburdened infrastructure system).", "Such incidents could materially disrupt operational information systems; result in loss or unwilling publication of trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information; compromise the privacy of personal information of consumers, employees, or others; jeopardize the security of our facilities; affect the performance of in-vehicle systems or services we offer; and/or impact the safety of our vehicles.", "This risk exposure rises as we continue to develop and produce vehicles with increased connectivity.", "Moreover, we, our suppliers, and our dealers have been the target of cybersecurity incidents and such threats are continuing and evolving, which may cause cybersecurity incidents to be more difficult to detect for periods of time.", "Our networks and in-vehicle systems, sharing similar architectures, could also be impacted by, or a cybersecurity incident may result from, the negligence or misconduct of insiders or third-parties who have access to our networks and systems.", "We employ capabilities, processes, and other security measures we believe are", "designed to detect, reduce, and mitigate the risk of cybersecurity incidents, and have requirements for our suppliers to do the same; however, we may not be aware of all vulnerabilities or might not accurately assess the risks of incidents, and such preventative measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be sufficient in all circumstances or mitigate all potential risks, including potential production disruption or the loss or disclosure of sensitive information.", "Moreover, a cybersecurity incident could harm our reputation, cause customers to lose trust in our security measures, and/or subject us to regulatory actions or litigation, which may result in fines, penalties, judgments, or injunctions, and a cybersecurity incident involving us or one of our suppliers could impact our production, internal operations, business strategy, results of operations, financial condition, or our ability to deliver products and services to our customers.", "Ford’s production, as well as Ford’s suppliers’ production, and/or the ability to deliver products to consumers could be disrupted by labor issues, public health issues, natural or man-made disasters, adverse effects of climate change, financial distress, production difficulties, capacity limitations, or other factors.", "A work stoppage or other limitation on production could occur at Ford’s facilities, at a facility in its supply chain, or at one of its logistics providers for any number of reasons, including as a result of labor issues, including shortages of available employees, disputes under existing collective bargaining agreements with labor unions or in connection with negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements, absenteeism, public health issues (e.g., COVID), stay-at-home orders, or in response to potential restructuring actions (e.g., plant closures); as a result of supplier financial distress or other production constraints, such as limited quantities of components or raw materials, quality issues, capacity limitations, or other difficulties; as a result of a natural disaster (including climate-related physical risk); social unrest; cybersecurity incidents; or for other reasons.", "A suspension or substantial curtailment of our manufacturing operations could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as was the case in 2020, when, consistent with actions taken by governmental authorities, we idled our plants in regions around the world.", "The duration of a suspension of manufacturing operations and a return to our full production schedule will vary.", "Our Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro operations generally do not realize revenue while our manufacturing operations are suspended, but we continue to incur operating and non-operating expenses, resulting in a deterioration of our cash flow.", "Accordingly, any significant future disruption to our production schedule, regionally or globally, whether as a result of our own or a supplier’s suspension of operations, could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.", "Moreover, our supply and distribution chains may be disrupted by supplier or dealer bankruptcies or their permanent discontinuation of operations triggered by a shutdown of operations.", "The limited availability of components, labor shortages, public health emergencies, and supplier operating issues has led to intermittent interruptions in our supply chain and an inconsistent production schedule at our facilities.", "This has exacerbated the disruption to our suppliers’ operations, which, in turn, has led to higher costs and production shortfalls.", "As a result of this disrupted production schedule, we have received and continue to receive claims from our supply base for reimbursement of costs beyond our original agreed terms.", "Upon receipt, we evaluate those claims, and, in certain circumstances, we have made payments to our suppliers, and this trend may continue.", "Given the worldwide scope of our supply chain and operations, we and our suppliers face a risk of disruption or operating inefficiencies that may increase costs due to the adverse physical effects of climate change, which are predicted to increase the frequency and severity of weather and other natural events, e.g., wildfires, extended droughts, and extreme temperatures.", "In addition, in the event a weather-related event, strike, international conflict, or other occurrence limits the ability of freight carriers to deliver components and other materials from suppliers to us or logistics providers to transport our vehicles for an extended period of time, it may increase our costs and delay or otherwise impact both our production operations and customers’ ability to receive our vehicles.", "Many components used in our vehicles are available only from a single or limited number of suppliers and, therefore, cannot be re-sourced quickly or inexpensively to another supplier (due to long lead times, new contractual commitments that may be required by another supplier before ramping up to provide the components or materials, etc.).", "Such suppliers also could threaten to disrupt our production as leverage in negotiations.", "In addition, when we undertake a model changeover, significant downtime at one or more of our production facilities may be required, and our ability to return to full production may be delayed if we experience production difficulties at one of our facilities or a supplier’s facility.", "Moreover, as vehicles, components, and their integration become more complex, we may face an increased risk of a delay in production of new vehicles.", "Regardless of the cause, our ability to recoup lost production volume may be limited.", "Accordingly, a significant disruption to our production schedule could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and may impact our strategy to comply with fuel economy standards as discussed below under “Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations.”", "Failure to develop and deploy secure digital services that appeal to customers could have a negative impact on", "Ford’s business.", "A growing part of our business involves connectivity, digital and physical services, and integrated software services, and we are devoting significant resources to develop this business.", "If we fail to generate sufficient demand for our integrated software and digital services or if customers do not opt to activate the modems in our vehicles, which would hinder our ability to offer and sell such services, we may not grow revenue in line with the costs we are investing or achieve profitability on our increasingly digitally-connected products.", "For additional discussion on the market acceptance of our services, see below under “Ford’s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries, and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced.”", "We contract with third parties to offer digital content to customers and license technologies for use in our software and digital services.", "This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into our own services; however, continuation of these third-party licensing and other arrangements, or their renewal on commercially reasonable terms, is not guaranteed or may be unavailable.", "Moreover, while we seek to grow our share of this business, third parties may be less inclined to continue developing or licensing software for Ford’s products or permit the Company to distribute their content, or such providers may offer competing products and services to the detriment of our business.", "If we are unable to offer integrated software applications and digital services on competitive terms, it may reduce customer demand or increase our costs to provide such applications and services, which we may be unable to pass on to customers.", "Alternatively, we may have to develop or license new content or technology to provide digital services, and there can be no assurance we would be able to develop or license such content or technology at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner, either of which could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or reputation.", "Sophisticated software integration may have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or other software products and services.", "In addition, the services we offer can have quality issues and may, from time to time, experience outages, service slowdowns, or errors.", "As a result, these services may not always perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations.", "There can be no assurance we will be able to detect and remedy all issues and defects in the hardware, software, and services we offer, or successfully deliver over-the-air (“OTA”) updates.", "Failure to do so on a timely basis could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting our products and services.", "For additional discussion on the risks associated with defects and quality issues, see above under “Ford’s vehicles could be affected by defects that result in recall campaigns, increased warranty costs, or delays in new model launches, and the time it takes to improve the quality of our vehicles and services could continue to have an adverse effect on our business.”", "The actions of end users are generally beyond our control and some users may engage in fraudulent or abusive activities that involve our digital services.", "These include unauthorized use of accounts through stolen credentials, failure to pay for services accessed, or other activities that violate our terms of service.", "While we have implemented security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our digital services and related information systems, malicious entities have and will continue to attempt to gain unauthorized access to them.", "If our efforts to detect such violations or our actions to control these types of fraud and abuse are not effective or timely, it may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or reputation.", "For further information, see above under “Operational information systems, security systems, vehicles, and services could be affected by cybersecurity incidents, ransomware attacks, and other disruptions and impact Ford and Ford Credit as well as their suppliers and dealers.”", "Ford’s ability to maintain a competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraints.", "The vast majority of the hourly employees in our manufacturing operations in the United States and Canada are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements.", "These agreements provide guaranteed wage and benefit levels throughout the contract term and some degree of income security, subject to certain conditions.", "With the ratification of our new contracts with the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (“UAW”) in the United States and Unifor in Canada in 2023, we expect to have a significant increase in labor costs through the life of the contracts, and if we are unable to offset those costs, it could have a significant adverse effect on our business.", "Further, these agreements may restrict our ability to close plants and divest businesses.", "Some of our competitors do not have such collective bargaining agreements and are not subject to the same constraints.", "A substantial number of our employees in other regions are represented by unions or government councils, and legislation or custom promoting retention of manufacturing or other employment in the state, country, or region may constrain as a practical matter our ability to sell or close manufacturing or other facilities or increase the cost of doing so.", "Ford’s ability to attract, develop, grow, and reward talent is critical to its success and competitiveness.", "Our success depends on our ability to continue to attract, develop, grow, and reward talented and diverse employees with domain expertise in engineering, software, technology (including digital capabilities and connectivity), integrated services, supply chain, marketing, and finance, among other areas.", "While we have been successful in attracting talent in recent years, as with any company, the ability to continue to attract talent is important, particularly in growth areas vital to our success such as software, electrification, and integrated services.", "Competition for such talent is intense, which has led to an increase in compensation throughout a tight labor market, and, accordingly, may increase costs for companies.", "In addition to attracting talent, we must also retain the talent needed to deliver our business objectives.", "While compensation considerations remain important, current and potential employees are increasingly placing a premium on various intangibles, such as working for companies with a clear purpose and strong brand reputation, flexible work arrangements, and other considerations, such as embracing sustainability and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.", "If we are not perceived as an employer of choice, we may be unable to recruit the best talent.", "Further, if we lose existing employees with needed skills or we are unable to develop existing employees, particularly with the introduction of new technologies and our focus on operational efficiency and quality, it could have a substantial adverse effect on our business.", "Ford’s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries, and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced.", "Although we conduct extensive market research before launching new or refreshed vehicles and introducing new services, many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products and services in the marketplace, and we may not be able to accurately predict or identify emerging trends or preferences or the success of new products or services in the market.", "It takes years to design and develop a new vehicle or change an existing vehicle.", "Because customers’ preferences may change quickly, our new and existing products may not generate sales in sufficient quantities and at costs low enough to be profitable and recoup investment costs.", "Offering vehicles and services that customers want and value can mitigate the risks of increasing price competition and declining demand, but products and services that are perceived to be less desirable (whether in terms of price, quality, styling, safety, overall value, fuel efficiency, or other attributes) can exacerbate these risks.", "For example, if we are unable to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors, develop innovative new products and services, or sufficiently tailor our products and services to customers in other markets, there could be insufficient demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.", "With increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet, social media, and other media, mere allegations relating to quality, safety, fuel efficiency, sustainability, corporate social responsibility, or other key attributes can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our products or services, even where such allegations prove to be inaccurate or unfounded.", "Further, our ability to successfully grow through capacity expansion and investments in the areas of electrification, connectivity, digital and physical services, and software services depends on many factors, including advancements in technology, regulatory changes, infrastructure development (e.g., a widespread vehicle charging network), and other factors that are difficult to predict, that may significantly affect the future of electric vehicles, autonomous technologies, digital and physical services, and software services.", "The automotive, software, and digital service businesses are very competitive and are undergoing rapid changes.", "Traditional competitors are expanding their offerings, and new types of competitors (particularly in our areas of strength, e.g., pick-up trucks, utilities, and commercial vehicles) that may possess superior technology, may have business models with certain aspects that are more efficient, and are not subject to the same level of fixed costs as us, are entering the market.", "For example, Chinese electric vehicle producers are exporting their products to some key markets in which we operate.", "This level of competition necessitates that we invest in and integrate emerging technologies into our business and increases the importance of our ability to anticipate, develop, and deliver products and services that customers desire on a timely basis, in quantities in line with demand, with the quality they expect, and at costs low enough to be profitable.", "Moreover, if we do not meet customer expectations for quickly and effectively addressing and remedying issues that may develop with or that improve our products and services, e.g., successfully delivering OTA updates, it would have an adverse effect on our business.", "We have announced our intent to continue making multi-billion dollar investments in electrification and software services.", "Our plans include offering electrified versions of many of our vehicles, including the F-150 Lightning and E-Transit.", "If the market for electrified vehicles does not develop at the rate we expect, even if the regulatory framework encourages a rapid adoption of electrified vehicles, there is a negative perception of our vehicles or about electric vehicles in general, we are unable to or are delayed in developing or embracing new technologies or processes, or if consumers prefer our competitors’ vehicles, there could be an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.", "Further, as discussed below under “Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations,” lower than planned market acceptance of our vehicles may impact our strategy to comply with fuel economy standards.", "Ford is addressing its impact on climate change aligned with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (Paris Agreement) by working to reduce our carbon footprint over time across our vehicles, operations, and supply chain.", "We have announced interim emissions targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and made other statements about similar initiatives, e.g., our expected electric vehicle volumes in future years.", "Achievement of these initiatives will require significant investments and the implementation of new processes; however, there is no assurance that the desired outcomes will be achieved.", "To the extent we are unable to achieve these initiatives or our transition to electrification is slower than expected, it may harm our reputation or we may not otherwise receive the expected return on the investment.", "For example, we are exposed to reputational risk if we do not reduce vehicle CO2 emissions in line with our targets or in compliance with applicable regulations.", "Further, our customers, investors, and other stakeholders evaluate how well we are progressing on our announced climate goals and aspirations, and if we are not on track to achieve those goals and aspirations on a timely basis, or if the expectations of our customers and investors change and we do not adequately address their expectations, our reputation could be impacted, and customers may choose to purchase the products and services of, investors may choose to invest in, and suppliers and vendors may choose to do business with other companies.", "Other parties may object to the positions we have taken and may, in the future, take on environmental, social, or other issues, or in the event we change our position on such issues, which may result in a loss of customers, a boycott of our products or services, or other actions that may impact not only our brand and reputation but also our results of operations, financial condition, and the price of our Common Stock.", "Moreover, new offerings, including those related to electric vehicles and autonomous driving technologies, may present technological challenges that could be costly to implement and overcome and may subject us to customer claims if they do not operate as anticipated.", "In addition, since new technologies are subject to market acceptance, a malfunction involving any manufacturer’s autonomous vehicle may negatively impact the perception of autonomous vehicles and autonomous vehicle technologies and erode customer trust.", "Ford’s results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United States.", "A shift in consumer preferences away from larger, more profitable vehicles with internal combustion engines (including trucks and utilities) to electric or other vehicles in our portfolio that may be less profitable could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.", "If demand for electric vehicles grows at a rate greater than our ability to increase our production capacity for those vehicles, lower market share and revenue, as well as facility and other asset-related charges (e.g., accelerated depreciation) associated with the production of internal combustion vehicles, may result.", "In addition, government regulations aimed at reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency (e.g., ZEV mandates and low emission zones) and other factors that accelerate the transition to electric vehicles may increase the cost of vehicles by more than the perceived benefit to consumers and dampen margins.", "With a global footprint and supply chain, Ford’s results and operations could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments, including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events.", "Because of the interconnectedness of the global economy, the challenges of a pandemic, a financial crisis, economic downturn or recession, natural disaster, war, geopolitical crises, or other significant events in one area of the world can have an immediate and material adverse impact on markets around the world.", "Changes in international trade policy can also have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or our business in general.", "Steps taken by governments to apply or consider applying tariffs on automobiles, parts, and other products and materials have the potential to disrupt existing supply chains, impose additional costs on our business, and could lead to other countries attempting to retaliate by imposing tariffs, which would make our products more expensive for customers, and, in turn, could make our products less competitive.", "In particular, China presents unique risks to U.S. automakers due to the strain in U.S.-China relations, China’s unique regulatory landscape, the level of integration with key components in our global supply chain, and the rapid development of the Chinese electric vehicle industry, with Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers exporting their products to some key markets in which we operate.", "With operations in various markets with volatile economic or political environments and our global supply chain and utilization of transportation routes and logistics providers around the world, we are exposed to heightened risks as a result of economic, geopolitical, or other events.", "This could include governmental takeover (i.e., nationalization) of our manufacturing facilities or intellectual property, restrictive exchange or import controls, disruption of operations as a result of systemic political or economic instability, outbreak of war or expansion of hostilities (such as the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas, heightened tensions in the Red Sea, and potential tensions in the South China Sea), and acts of terrorism, each of which could impact our supply chain as well as our operations and have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.", "Further, the U.S. government, other governments, and international organizations could impose additional sanctions or export controls that could restrict us from doing business directly or indirectly in or with certain countries or parties, which could include affiliates.", "Industry sales volume can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis, recession, public health emergency, or significant geopolitical event.", "Because we, like other manufacturers, have a higher proportion of fixed structural costs, relatively small changes in industry sales volume can have a substantial effect on our cash flow and results of operations.", "Vehicle sales are affected by overall economic and market conditions, consumer behavior, and developing trends such as shared vehicle ownership and ridesharing services.", "If industry vehicle sales were to decline to levels significantly below our planning assumption, the decline could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.", "For a discussion of economic trends, see Item 7.", "Ford may face increased price competition or a reduction in demand for its products resulting from industry excess capacity, currency fluctuations, competitive actions, or other factors, particularly for electric vehicles.", "The global automotive industry is intensely competitive, with installed manufacturing capacity generally exceeding current demand.", "Historically, industry overcapacity has resulted in many manufacturers offering marketing incentives on vehicles in an attempt to maintain and grow market share; these incentives historically have included a combination of subsidized financing or leasing programs, price rebates, and other incentives.", "As a result, we are not necessarily able to set our prices to offset higher marketing incentives, commodity or other cost increases, tariffs, or the impact of adverse currency fluctuations.", "This risk includes cost advantages foreign competitors may have because of their weaker home market currencies, which may, in turn, enable those competitors to offer their products at lower prices.", "Further, higher inventory levels put downward pressure on pricing, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.", "Although we continue to invest in our electric vehicle strategy, we have observed lower-than-anticipated industrywide electric vehicle adoption rates and near-term pricing pressures, which has led us and may in the future lead us to adjust our spending, production, and/or product launches to better match the pace of electric vehicle adoption.", "As a result of the lower- than-anticipated adoption rates, near-term pricing pressures, and other factors, we have accrued and may continue to incur charges, which could be substantial, related to payments to our electric vehicle-related suppliers (battery, raw material, or otherwise), inventory adjustments, or other matters.", "Battery costs remain high, which is detrimental to electric vehicles reaching pricing parity with ICE vehicles and further exacerbates the pricing pressures on electric vehicles.", "Furthermore, as we invest in battery production, including the construction of battery plants, if we are unable to operate those plants at their expected capacity because electric vehicle adoption rates remain lower-than-anticipated or otherwise, we may be unable to recoup the investments we have made.", "As electric vehicle adoption rates increase, the risk of excess capacity, particularly for internal combustion engine trucks and utilities, may be exacerbated.", "This excess capacity may further increase price competition in that segment of the market, which could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.", "Inflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and market value of Ford or Ford Credit’s investments, including marketable securities, can have a significant effect on results.", "We and our suppliers are exposed to inflationary pressure and a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates.", "We monitor and attempt to manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce potentially adverse effects on our business.", "Changes in commodity and energy prices (from tariffs and the actions taken by Russia in Ukraine, as discussed above under “With a global footprint and supply chain, Ford’s results and operations could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments, including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events,” or otherwise), currency exchange rates, and interest rates cannot always be predicted, hedged, or offset with price increases to eliminate earnings volatility.", "As a result, significant changes in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, or interest rates as well as increased material, freight, logistics, and similar costs could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.", "See Item 7 and Item 7A for additional discussion of currency, commodity and energy price, and interest rate risks.", "These market forces have caused us to incur higher material costs, which may continue, and our warranty costs have increased, in part, due to inflationary cost pressures at our dealers.", "Moreover, due to inflationary pressure, some of our suppliers have submitted claims to us for reimbursement of costs beyond our original agreed terms.", "Upon receipt, we evaluate those claims, and, in certain circumstances, we have made payments to our suppliers, and this trend may continue.", "Further, interest rates have increased significantly as central banks in developed countries attempt to subdue inflation while government deficits and debt remain at high levels in many global markets.", "Accordingly, the eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt, tighter monetary policy, and potentially higher long-term interest rates may drive a higher cost of capital for the business.", "At Ford Credit, rising interest rates may impact Ford Credit’s ability to source funding and offer financing at competitive rates, which could reduce its financing margin.", "In addition, our results are impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments, with unrealized gains and losses that could be material in any period.", "Ford and Ford Credit’s access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors.", "Ford and Ford Credit’s ability to obtain unsecured funding at a reasonable cost is dependent on their credit ratings or their perceived creditworthiness.", "Further, Ford Credit’s ability to obtain securitized funding under its committed asset-backed liquidity programs and certain other asset-backed securitization transactions is subject to having a sufficient amount of assets eligible for these programs, as well as Ford Credit’s ability to obtain appropriate credit ratings for those transactions and, for certain committed programs, derivatives to manage the interest rate risk.", "Over time, and particularly in the event of credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, or other factors, Ford Credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates because of funding constraints.", "In addition, Ford Credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates if there is a significant decline in the demand for the types of securities it offers or Ford Credit is unable to obtain derivatives to manage the interest rate risk associated with its securitization transactions.", "A significant reduction in the amount of receivables Ford Credit purchases or originates would significantly reduce its ongoing results of operations and could adversely affect its ability to support the sale of Ford vehicles.", "To the extent interest rates remain relatively high, they may have an adverse effect on borrowing costs for Ford Credit, making it more expensive to fund our operations or leading to higher rates charged to our customers if these costs are", "The impact of government incentives on Ford’s business could be significant, and Ford’s receipt of government incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback.", "We receive economic benefits from national, state, and local governments in various regions of the world in the form of incentives designed to encourage manufacturers to establish, maintain, or increase investment, workforce, or production.", "These incentives may take various forms, including grants, loan subsidies, or tax abatements or credits.", "The impact of these incentives can be significant in a particular market during a reporting period.", "A decrease in, expiration without renewal of, or other cessation or clawback of government incentives for any of our operations, as a result of administrative decision or otherwise, could have a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.", "For example, until 2021, most of our manufacturing facilities in South America were located in Brazil, where the state or federal governments historically offered significant incentives to manufacturers to encourage capital investment, increase manufacturing production, and create jobs.", "As a result, the performance of our South American operations had been impacted favorably by government incentives to a substantial extent.", "The federal government in Brazil has levied assessments against us concerning the federal incentives we previously received, and the State of São Paulo has challenged the grant to us of tax incentives by the State of Bahia.", "See Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for discussion of our accounting for government incentives, and “Item 3.", "Legal Proceedings” for a discussion of tax proceedings in Brazil and the potential requirement for us to post collateral.", "The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) provides, among other things, financial incentives in the form of tax credits to grow the domestic supply chain and domestic manufacturing base for electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), and other “clean” vehicles.", "The law likewise incentivizes the purchase of clean vehicles and the infrastructure to fuel them.", "These incentives change over time and will remain in effect until approximately 2032, unless modified by Congress.", "The IRA’s incentives are having and are expected to have material impacts on the automotive industry and Ford.", "The IRA authorizes tax credits to manufacturers for the domestic production of batteries and battery components for EVs and PHEVs, and this credit is expected to improve the financial performance of domestic battery manufacturers, including the new operations at our upcoming facility in Michigan and BlueOval SK’s facilities in Kentucky and Tennessee.", "Further, the degree of success of some of our investment strategies depends upon IRA tax credit eligibility and for those credits to continue to remain available through the currently contemplated expiration.", "The IRA also authorizes tax credits for purchasers of qualified commercial and retail clean vehicles.", "Ford expects that most commercial customers that purchase an EV or PHEV will be eligible for the commercial clean vehicle credit, although it is unclear at this time how many commercial vehicle purchasers will have the underlying federal tax liability that is necessary to actually monetize this credit.", "When paired with the IRA’s tax credit for the construction of certain electric vehicle charging infrastructure, Ford expects the commercial clean vehicle credit will influence commercial fleets, governmental fleets, and other vehicle purchasers in their evaluation of a transition from internal combustion engine vehicles to EVs and PHEVs.", "To claim the retail tax credit, the IRA establishes numerous and complex prerequisites, including that the vehicle must be assembled in North America; the vehicle must be under specified limitations on manufacturer suggested retail price (“MSRP”); purchaser income limitations; starting in 2024, any vehicle that contains “battery components” that were “manufactured or assembled” by a “foreign entity of concern” will be ineligible; and, starting in 2025, any vehicle that contains battery materials that were “extracted, processed, or recycled” by a “foreign entity of concern” will be ineligible.", "A “Critical Minerals Credit” is available for those vehicles that have a specified percentage of critical minerals that are “extracted or produced” in the United States, in a country with which the United States has a Free Trade Agreement, or that is “recycled” in North America.", "A “Battery Components Credit” is available for those vehicles that have a specified percentage of “value” of its battery “components” that are “manufactured or assembled” in North America.", "Although we ultimately expect the IRA to benefit Ford and the automotive industry in general, the availability of such benefits will depend on the further development and improvement of the U.S. battery supply, sufficient access to raw materials within the scope of the IRA, and the terms of the regulations and guidance (and the limitations therein) the U.S. government issues to implement the IRA, which will ultimately determine which vehicles qualify for incentives and the amount thereof.", "Automakers that better optimize eligibility for their vehicles, as compared to their competition, will have a competitive advantage.", "Ford Credit could experience higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values, or higher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles.", "Credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer’s or dealer’s failure to make payments according to contract terms.", "Credit risk (which is heavily dependent upon economic factors including unemployment, consumer debt service burden, personal income growth, dealer profitability, and used car prices) has a significant impact on Ford Credit’s business.", "The level of credit losses Ford Credit may experience could exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations.", "In addition, Ford Credit projects expected residual values (including residual value support payments from Ford) and return volumes for the vehicles it leases.", "Actual proceeds realized by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned leased vehicles at lease termination may be lower than the amount projected, which would reduce Ford Credit’s return on the lease transaction.", "Among the factors that can affect the value of returned lease vehicles are the volume and mix of vehicles returned industry-wide, economic conditions, marketing programs, and quality or perceived quality, safety, fuel efficiency, or reliability of the vehicles, or changes in propulsion technology and related legislative changes.", "Actual return volumes may be influenced by these factors, as well as by contractual lease-end values relative to auction values.", "If auction values decrease significantly in the future, return volumes could exceed Ford Credit’s expectations.", "Each of these factors, alone or in combination, has the potential to adversely affect Ford Credit’s results of operations if actual results were to differ significantly from Ford Credit’s projections.", "See “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Item 7 for additional discussion.", "Economic and demographic experience for pension and OPEB plans (e.g., discount rates or investment returns) could be worse than Ford has assumed.", "The measurement of our obligations, costs, and liabilities associated with benefits pursuant to our pension and OPEB plans requires that we estimate the present value of projected future payments to all participants.", "We use many assumptions in calculating these estimates, including assumptions related to discount rates, investment returns on designated plan assets, and demographic experience (e.g., mortality and retirement rates).", "We generally remeasure these estimates at each year end and recognize any gains or losses associated with changes to our plan assets and liabilities in the year incurred.", "To the extent actual results are less favorable than our assumptions, we may recognize a remeasurement loss in our results, which could be substantial.", "For additional information regarding our assumptions, see “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Item 7 and Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.", "Pension and other postretirement liabilities could adversely affect Ford’s liquidity and financial condition.", "We have defined benefit retirement plans in the United States that cover many of our hourly and salaried employees.", "We also provide pension benefits to non-U.S. employees and retirees, primarily in Europe.", "In addition, we sponsor plans to provide OPEB for retired employees (primarily health care and life insurance benefits).", "See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information about these plans.", "These benefit plans impose significant liabilities on us and could require us to make additional cash contributions, which could impair our liquidity.", "If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to meet any pension or OPEB obligations, we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, suspend dividend payments, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness.", "Ford and Ford Credit could experience unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations, or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in products, services, perceived environmental impacts, or otherwise.", "We spend substantial resources to comply with governmental safety regulations, mobile and stationary source emissions regulations, consumer and automotive financial regulations, and other standards, but we cannot ensure that employees or other individuals affiliated with us will not violate such laws or regulations.", "In addition, as discussed below under “Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations” and “Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations, consumer protection regulations, or other regulations,” regulatory standards and interpretations may change on short notice and impact our compliance status.", "Government investigations against Ford or Ford Credit could result in fines, penalties, orders, or other resolutions that could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or the operation of our business.", "Moreover, compliance with governmental standards does not necessarily prevent individual or class action lawsuits, which can entail significant cost and risk.", "In certain circumstances, courts may permit civil actions even where our vehicles, services, and financial products comply with federal and/or other applicable law.", "Furthermore, simply responding to actual or threatened litigation or government investigations of our compliance with regulatory standards, whether related to our products, services, or business or commercial relationships, requires significant expenditures of time and other resources.", "Litigation also is inherently uncertain, and we have in the past experienced and could in the future experience significant adverse results, including compensatory and punitive damage awards, a disgorgement of profits or revenue, or injunctive relief, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or our business in general, particularly with larger jury verdicts becoming more prevalent.", "In addition, adverse publicity surrounding an allegation, litigation, or investigation, even if there is no merit to the matter, may cause significant reputational harm or create a negative public perception of our products and services, which could have a significant adverse effect on our sales.", "Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations.", "The automotive industry is subject to regulations worldwide that govern product characteristics and that differ by global region, country, and sometimes within national boundaries.", "Regulators have enacted and are proposing standards to address concerns regarding the environment (including concerns about global climate change and air quality), vehicle safety, and energy independence, and the regulatory landscape can change on short notice.", "These regulations vary, but generally require that over time motor vehicles and engines emit less air pollution, including GHG emissions, oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter, and there are associated increased reporting requirements.", "Similarly, we are making substantial investments in our facilities and revising our processes to not only comply with applicable regulations but also to make our operations more efficient and sustainable.", "As our suppliers make similar investments, any higher costs may be passed on to us.", "In the United States, legal and policy debates on environmental regulations are continuing, with a primary trend toward reducing GHG emissions and increasing vehicle electrification.", "Recently, different federal administrations have either sought to make standards more strict or to make them less strict, with one administration often replacing the regulations enacted by the last.", "Various third parties routinely seek judicial review of these federal regulatory and deregulatory efforts.", "In parallel, California continues to enact increasingly strict emissions standards and requirements for ZEVs (standards that some other states are adopting), and those actions are also the subject of legal challenges.", "Court rulings regarding regulatory actions by federal, California, and other state regulators create uncertainty and the potential for applicable regulatory standards to change quickly.", "In addition, many governments regulate local product content or impose import requirements with the aim of creating jobs, protecting domestic producers, and influencing the balance of payments.", "We regularly refine our product cycle plan to improve the fuel economy of our internal combustion vehicles and to offer more propulsion choices, such as hybrid and electrified vehicles, that generate lower GHG emissions.", "Electrification is our core strategy to comply with current and anticipated environmental laws and regulations in major markets.", "However, there are limits to our ability to reduce emissions and increase fuel economy over given time frames and many factors that could delay or impede our plans.", "Those factors primarily relate to the cost and effectiveness of available technologies; consumer acceptance of new technologies and their costs; changes in vehicle mix (as described in more detail above under “Ford’s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries, and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced”); the appropriateness (or lack thereof) of certain technologies for use in particular vehicles; the widespread availability (or lack thereof) of supporting infrastructure for new technologies, including charging for electric vehicles; the availability (or lack thereof) of the raw materials and component supply to make affordable batteries and other elements of electric vehicles; and the human, engineering, and financial", "resources necessary to deploy new technologies across a wide range of products and powertrains in a short time.", "If fuel prices are relatively low and market conditions or the consumer attributes", "of our vehicles do not lead consumers to purchase electric vehicles and other highly fuel-efficient vehicles in sufficient numbers, it may be difficult to meet applicable environmental standards.", "Moreover, the rates of EV growth, production disruptions, stop ships, supply chain limitations, lower-than-planned market acceptance of our vehicles, and/or other circumstances may cause us to modify product plans, or, in some cases, purchase credits, which we have done, in order to comply with emissions standards, fuel economy standards, or ZEV requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and cause reputational harm.", "Increased scrutiny of automaker emission compliance by regulators around the world has led to new regulations, more stringent enforcement programs, additional field actions, demands for reporting on the field performance of emissions components and higher scrutiny of field data, and delays in regulatory approvals.", "The cost to comply with government regulations concerning new vehicle standards and in-use vehicle requirements, including field service actions, is substantial.", "Additional regulations, changes in regulatory interpretations, or changes in consumer preferences that affect vehicle mix, as well as any non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, could have a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.", "In addition, a number of governments, as well as non-governmental organizations, publicly assess vehicles to their own protocols.", "Any negative perception regarding the performance of our vehicles subjected to such tests could reduce future sales.", "Court decisions arising out of consumer and investor litigation could give rise to de facto

definitions of personal information, are subject to change and uncertain interpretations by courts and regulators, and may be inconsistent from state to state or country to country.", "Accordingly, complying with such laws and regulations may lead to a decline in consumer engagement or cause us to incur substantial costs to modify our operations or business practices.", "Moreover, regulatory actions seeking to impose significant financial penalties for noncompliance and/or legal actions (including pursuant to laws providing for private rights of action by consumers) could be brought against us in the event of a data compromise, misuse of consumer information, or perceived or actual non-compliance with data protection, privacy, or artificial intelligence requirements.", "The rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may intensify these risks.", "Further, any unauthorized release of personal information could harm our reputation, disrupt our

rates are market-determined, and all are impacted by many different macroeconomic and policy factors, and thus likely to remain volatile.", "However, in some markets, exchange rates are heavily influenced or controlled by governments.", "Pricing Pressure.", "Despite vehicle pricing remaining elevated over the last year due to strong demand, supply shortages, and inflationary costs, we have already observed moderation in the rate of new and used vehicle price increases as auto production recovers from the semiconductor shortage, but it is unclear whether prices will decline fully to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels.", "Over the long term, intense competition and excess capacity are likely to put downward pressure on inflation-adjusted prices for similarly-contented vehicles and contribute to a challenging pricing environment for the automotive industry in most major markets.", "Electric Vehicle Market.", "Although we continue to invest in our electric vehicle strategy, we

otherwise), inventory adjustments, or other", "matters.", "See Item 1A.", "Risk Factors for additional discussion of the risks related to lower-than-anticipated electric vehicle volumes and our planned transition to a greater mix of electric vehicles.", "Commodity and Energy Prices.", "Prices for commodities remain volatile.", "In some cases, spot prices for various commodities have recently diverged somewhat, as anticipated weakening in global industrial activity mitigates price increases for base metals such as steel and aluminum, while precious metals (e.g., palladium), and raw materials that are used in batteries for electric vehicles (e.g., lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, among other materials, for batteries) remain elevated.", "The net impact on us and our suppliers has been higher material costs overall.", "To help ensure supply of raw materials for critical components (e.g., batteries), we, like others in the industry, have entered into multi-year sourcing agreements and may enter into additional agreements.", "Similar dynamics are impacting energy markets, with Europe particularly exposed to the risk of both higher prices and constraints on supply of natural gas due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.", "Such shortages may impact facilities operated by us or our suppliers, which could have an impact on us in Europe and other regions.", "In the long term, the outcome of de-carbonization and electrification of the vehicle fleet may depress oil demand, but the global energy transition will also contribute to ongoing volatility of oil and other energy prices.", "Vehicle Profitability.", "Our financial results depend on the profitability of the vehicles we sell, which may vary significantly by vehicle line.", "In general, larger vehicles tend to command higher prices and be more profitable than smaller vehicles.", "For example, in Ford Blue, our larger, more profitable vehicles had an average contribution margin that was 139% of our total average contribution margin across all vehicles, whereas our smaller vehicles had significantly lower contribution margins.", "In addition, government regulations aimed at reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency (e.g., ZEV mandates and low emission zones), and other factors that accelerate the transition to electrified vehicles, may increase the cost of vehicles by more than the perceived benefit to consumers and dampen margins.", "Trade Policy.", "To the extent governments in various regions implement or intensify barriers to imports, such as erecting tariff or non-tariff barriers or manipulating their currency, and provide advantages to local exporters selling into the global marketplace, there can be a significant negative impact on manufacturers based in other markets.", "While we believe the long- term trend will support the growth of free trade, we will continue to monitor and address the developing role that geopolitical, climate, and labor concerns are playing in trade relations.", "Inflation and Interest Rates.", "We continue to see near-term impacts on our business due to inflation, including ongoing global price pressures in the wake of geopolitical volatility, driving up energy prices, freight premiums, and other operating costs above normal rates.", "Although headline inflation in the United States and Europe appears to have peaked, as gasoline and natural gas prices recede from the latest spike, core inflation (excluding food and energy prices) remains elevated and is a source of continued cost pressure on businesses and households.", "Interest rates have increased significantly as central banks in developed countries attempt to subdue inflation while government deficits and debt remain at high levels in many global markets.", "Accordingly, the eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt, tighter monetary policy, and potentially higher long-term interest rates may drive a higher cost of capital for the business.", "At Ford Credit, rising interest rates may impact its ability to source funding and offer financing at competitive rates, which could reduce its financing margin.", "Company excluding Ford Credit revenue is generated primarily by sales of vehicles, parts, accessories, and services from our Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro segments.", "Revenue is recorded when control is transferred to our customers (generally, our dealers and distributors).", "For the majority of sales, this occurs when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities.", "However, we defer a portion of the consideration received when there is a separate future or stand- ready performance obligation, such as extended service contracts or ongoing vehicle connectivity.", "Revenue related to extended service contracts is recognized over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs we expect to incur in satisfying the contract obligations; revenue related to other future or stand-ready performance obligations is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period in which services are expected to be performed.", "Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies with an obligation to repurchase at an agreed upon amount, exercisable at the option of the customer, are accounted for as operating leases, with lease revenue recognized over the term of the lease.", "Proceeds from the sale of vehicles at auction are recognized in revenue upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the buyer.", "Most of the vehicles sold by us to our dealers and distributors are financed at wholesale by Ford Credit.", "Upon Ford Credit originating the wholesale receivable related to a dealer’s purchase of a vehicle, Ford Credit pays cash to the relevant Ford entity in payment of the dealer’s obligation for the purchase price of the vehicle.", "The dealer then pays the wholesale finance receivable to Ford Credit when it sells the vehicle to a retail customer.", "Our Ford Credit segment revenue is generated primarily from interest on finance receivables and revenue from operating leases.", "Revenue from interest on finance receivables is recognized over the term of the receivable using the interest method and includes the amortization of certain deferred origination costs.", "Revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.", "Transactions between Ford Credit and our other segments occur in the ordinary course of business.", "For example, we offer special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers’ customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from Ford Credit.", "The cost for these incentives is included in our estimate of variable consideration at the date the related vehicle sales to our dealers are recorded.", "In order to compensate Ford Credit for the lower interest or lease payments offered to the retail customer, we pay the discounted value of the incentive directly to Ford Credit when it originates the retail finance or lease contract with the dealer’s customer.", "Ford Credit recognizes the incentive amount over the life of retail finance contracts as an element of financing revenue and over the life of lease contracts as a reduction to depreciation.", "See Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of transactions between Ford Credit and our other segments.", "Our income statement classifies our Company excluding Ford Credit total costs and expenses into two categories:", "(i) cost of sales, and (ii) selling, administrative, and other expenses.", "We include within cost of sales those costs related to the development, production, and distribution of our vehicles, parts, accessories, and services.", "Specifically, we include in cost of sales each of the following: material costs (including commodity costs); freight costs; warranty, including product recall costs; labor and other costs related to the development and production of our vehicles and connectivity, parts, accessories, and services; depreciation and amortization; and other associated costs.", "We include within selling, administrative, and other expenses labor and other costs not directly related to the development and production of our vehicles, parts, accessories, and services, including such expenses as advertising and sales promotion costs.", "Certain of our costs, such as material costs, generally vary directly with changes in volume and mix of production.", "In our industry, production volume often varies significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.", "Quarterly production volumes experience seasonal shifts throughout the year (including peak retail sales seasons and the impact on production of model changeover and new product launches).", "Annual production volumes are heavily impacted by external economic factors, including the pace of economic growth and factors such as the availability of consumer credit and cost of fuel.", "As a result, we analyze the profit impact of certain cost changes holding constant present-year volume and mix and currency exchange, in order to evaluate our cost trends absent the impact of varying production and currency exchange levels.", "We analyze these cost changes in the following categories:", "Contribution Costs – these costs typically vary with production volume.", "These costs include material (including commodity), warranty, and freight and duty costs.", "Structural Costs – these costs typically do not have a directly

the table above.", "As of December 31, 2023, our estimated expenditures for the maximum quantity that we are committed to purchase under these offtake agreements through 2035, subject to certain conditions, consist of approximately $4.5 billion of purchase obligations and approximately $8 billion of contingent purchase obligations based on our present forecast.", "However, our forecast could fluctuate from period to period based on market prices, which could result in significant increases or decreases in our estimate.", "The actual price paid for these materials will be recorded on our balance sheet at the time of purchase.", "In addition, as market conditions dictate, we may enter into additional offtake agreements with raw material suppliers or seek to renegotiate existing agreements.", "For additional information, see the discussion of our offtake agreements below on page 62.", "We plan to utilize our liquidity (as described above) and our cash flows from business operations to fund our material cash requirements.", "Changes in Company Cash.", "In managing our business, we classify changes in Company cash into operating and non- operating items.", "Operating items include: Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit EBT, capital spending, depreciation and tooling amortization, changes in working capital, Ford Credit distributions, interest on debt, cash taxes, and all other and timing differences (including timing differences between accrual-based EBIT and associated cash flows).", "Non-operating items include: restructuring costs, changes in Company debt excluding Ford Credit, contributions to funded pension plans, shareholder distributions, and other items (including gains and losses on investments in equity securities, acquisitions and divestitures, equity investments, and other transactions with Ford Credit).", "With respect to “Changes in working capital,” in general, the Company excluding Ford Credit carries relatively low trade receivables compared with our trade payables because the majority of our wholesales are financed (primarily by Ford Credit) immediately upon the sale of vehicles to dealers, which generally occurs shortly after being produced.", "In contrast, our trade payables are based primarily on industry-standard production supplier payment terms of about 45 days.", "As a result, our cash flow deteriorates if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) decrease while trade payables continue to become due.", "Conversely, our cash flow improves if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) increase while new trade payables are generally not due for about 45 days.", "For example, the suspension of production at most of our assembly plants and lower industry volumes due to COVID-19 in early 2020 resulted in an initial deterioration of our cash flow, while the subsequent resumption of manufacturing operations and return to pre-COVID-19 production levels at most of our assembly plants resulted in a subsequent improvement of our cash flow.", "Even in normal economic conditions, however, these working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow.", "For example, we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables due to our annual shutdown periods when production, and therefore inventories and wholesale volumes, are usually at their lowest levels, while payables continue to come due and be paid.", "The net impact of this typically results in cash outflows from changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods.", "Our finished product inventory at December 31, 2023 was higher than at December 31, 2022, primarily reflecting higher in-transit inventory.", "In response to, or in anticipation of, supplier disruptions, we may stockpile certain components or raw materials to help prevent disruption in our production of vehicles.", "Such actions could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory.", "Moreover, in order to secure critical materials for production of electric vehicles, we have entered into and we may, in the future, enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers, including contributing up to a maximum of $6.6 billion in capital to BlueOval SK, LLC over a five-year period ending in 2026.", "Our actual capital outlay could vary significantly based on the final project costs and potential financing opportunities.", "Such investments could have an additional adverse impact on our cash in the near-term.", "The terms of the offtake agreements we have entered into, and those we may enter into in the future, vary by transaction, though they generally obligate us to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output produced by the counterparty over an agreed upon period of time.", "The purchase price mechanism included in the offtake agreement is typically based on the market price of the material at the time of delivery.", "The terms also may include conditions to our obligation to purchase the materials, such as quality or minimum output.", "Subject to satisfaction of those conditions, we will be obligated to purchase the materials at the cost determined by the purchase price mechanism.", "Based on the offtake agreements we have entered into thus far, the earliest date by which we could be obligated to purchase any output, subject to satisfaction of the applicable conditions, will be in 2024.", "Unlike our historical arrangements with suppliers, under multi-year offtake agreements, the risks associated with lower- than-expected electric vehicle production volumes or changes in battery technology that reduce the need for certain raw materials are borne by Ford rather than our suppliers.", "Accordingly, in the event we do not purchase the materials pursuant to the terms of these agreements and we are unable to restructure an agreement or an alternate purchaser is unable to be found, Ford retains its obligation for the cost of those materials.", "For additional discussion of the risks related to our offtake agreements and other long-term purchase contracts, see “Item 1A.", "Risk Factors.”", "Financial institutions participate in a supply chain finance (“SCF”) program that enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their Ford receivables (i.e., our payment obligations to the suppliers) to the financial institutions on a non- recourse basis in order to be paid earlier than our payment terms provide.", "Our suppliers’ voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms, the amounts we pay, or our liquidity.", "We have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the SCF program, and we do not provide any guarantees in connection with it.", "As of December 31, 2023, the

borrowings.", "We are exposed to a variety of other risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury.", "We protect against these risks through the purchase of commercial insurance that is designed to protect us above our self- insured retentions against events that could generate significant losses.", "Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurer’s Office and is governed by written policies and procedures.", "Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows.", "Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective.", "In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are approved by the GRMC, and reviewed by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.", "In accordance with our corporate risk management policies, we use derivative instruments, when available, such as forward contracts, swaps, and options that economically hedge certain exposures (foreign currency, commodity, and interest rates).", "We do not use derivative contracts for trading, market-making, or speculative purposes.", "In certain instances, we forgo hedge accounting, and in certain other instances, our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting.", "Either situation results in unrealized gains and losses that are recognized in income.", "For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 20 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.", "The market and counterparty risks of the Company excluding Ford Credit as well as our Ford Credit segment are discussed and quantified below.", "We frequently have expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations.", "These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates.", "We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in the production of our vehicles and changes in interest rates.", "Foreign currency risk, commodity risk, and interest rate risk are measured and quantified using a model to evaluate the sensitivity of market value to instantaneous, parallel shifts in rates and/or prices.", "Foreign Currency Risk.", "Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be worse than planned because of changes in currency exchange rates.", "Accordingly, our practice is to use derivative instruments to hedge our economic exposure with respect to forecasted revenues and costs, assets, liabilities, and firm commitments denominated in certain foreign currencies consistent with our overall risk management strategy.", "In our hedging actions, we use derivative instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts).", "The extent to which we hedge is also impacted by materiality of the risk in the context of our overall portfolio, market liquidity, and/or our ability to achieve designated hedge accounting.", "The net fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts (including adjustments for credit risk) as of December 31, 2023, was a liability of $319 million, compared with an asset of $236 million as of December 31, 2022.", "The potential change in the fair value from a 10% change in the underlying exchange rates, in U.S. dollar terms, would have been $3.1 billion at December 31, 2023, compared with $1.9 billion at December 31, 2022.", "The sensitivity analysis presented is hypothetical and assumes foreign exchange rate changes are instantaneous and adverse across all currencies.", "In reality, some of our exposures offset and foreign exchange rates move in different magnitudes and at different times, and any changes in fair value would generally be offset by changes in the underlying exposure.", "See Note 20 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding our foreign currency exchange contracts.", "Commodity Price Risk.", "Commodity price risk is the possibility that our financial results could be worse than planned because of changes in the prices of commodities used in the production of motor vehicles, such as base metals (e.g., steel, copper, and aluminum), precious metals (e.g., palladium), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene).", "As we transition to a greater mix of electric vehicles, we expect to increase our reliance on lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, among other materials, for batteries.", "Our practice is to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk with respect to forecasted purchases of certain commodities consistent with our overall risk management strategy.", "In our hedging actions, we use derivative instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts).", "The extent to which we hedge is also impacted by materiality of the risk in the context of our overall portfolio, market liquidity, and/or our ability to achieve designated hedge accounting.", "The net fair value of commodity forward contracts (including adjustments for credit risk) as of December 31, 2023, was a liability of $9 million, compared with a liability of $49 million as of December 31, 2022.", "The potential change in the fair value from a 10% change in the underlying commodity prices would have been $203 million at December 31, 2023, compared with", "$178 million at December 31, 2022.", "The sensitivity analysis presented is hypothetical and assumes commodity price changes are instantaneous and adverse across all commodities.", "In reality, commodity prices move in different magnitudes and at different times, and any changes in fair value would generally be offset by changes in the underlying exposure.", "In addition, our purchasing organization (with guidance from the GRMC, as appropriate) negotiates contracts for the continuous supply of raw materials.", "In some cases, these contracts stipulate minimum purchase amounts and specific prices, and, therefore, play a role in managing commodity price risk.", "Interest Rate Risk.", "Interest rate risk relates to the loss we could incur in our Company cash investment portfolios due to a change in interest rates.", "Our interest rate sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolios includes cash and cash equivalents and net marketable securities.", "At December 31, 2023, we had Company cash of $28.8 billion in our investment portfolios, compared to $32.3 billion at December 31, 2022.", "We invest the portfolios in securities of various types and maturities, the value of which are subject to fluctuations in interest rates.", "The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short-term investments.", "In investing the cash in our investment portfolios, safety of principal is the primary objective and risk-adjusted return is the secondary objective.", "At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our portfolios.", "Assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our portfolios would be reduced by $222 million, as calculated as of December 31, 2023.", "This compares to $256 million, as calculated as of December 31, 2022.", "While these are our best estimates of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected.", "The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve.", "In reality, interest rate changes of this magnitude are rarely instantaneous or parallel.", "Market risk for Ford Credit is the possibility that changes in interest and currency exchange rates will adversely affect cash flow and economic value.", "Interest Rate Risk.", "Generally, Ford Credit’s assets and the related debt have different re-pricing periods, and consequently, respond differently to changes in interest rates.", "Ford Credit’s assets consist primarily of fixed-rate retail financing and operating lease contracts and floating-rate wholesale receivables.", "Fixed-rate retail financing and operating lease contracts generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract.", "Wholesale receivables are originated to finance new and used vehicles held in dealers’ inventory and generally require dealers to pay a floating rate.", "Debt consists primarily of short- and long-term unsecured and securitized debt.", "Ford Credit’s term debt instruments are principally fixed-rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity.", "Ford Credit’s interest rate risk management objective is to reduce volatility in its cash flows and volatility in its economic value from changes in interest rates based on an established risk tolerance that may vary by market.", "Ford Credit uses economic value sensitivity analysis and re-pricing gap analysis to evaluate potential long-term effects of changes in interest rates.", "It then enters into interest rate swaps to convert portions of its floating-rate debt to fixed or its fixed-rate debt to floating to ensure that Ford Credit’s exposure falls within the established tolerances.", "Ford Credit also uses pre-tax cash flow sensitivity analysis to monitor the level of near-term cash flow exposure.", "The pre-tax cash flow sensitivity analysis measures the changes in expected cash flows associated with Ford Credit’s interest-rate-sensitive assets, liabilities, and derivative financial instruments from hypothetical changes in interest rates over a twelve-month horizon.", "Interest rate swaps are placed to maintain exposure within approved thresholds and the Asset-Liability Committee reviews the re-pricing mismatch monthly.", "To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its pre-tax cash flow to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease of one percentage point in all interest rates across all maturities (a “parallel shift”), as well as a base case that assumes that all interest rates remain constant at existing levels.", "In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in Ford Credit’s analysis.", "As a result, the actual impact to pre-tax cash flow could be higher or lower than the results detailed in the table below.", "These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent Ford Credit’s view of future interest rate movements.", "Under these interest rate scenarios, Ford Credit expects more assets than debt and liabilities to re-price in the next twelve months.", "Other things being equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest received on Ford Credit’s assets will increase more than the interest paid on Ford Credit’s debt, thereby initially increasing Ford Credit’s pre-tax cash flow.", "During a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credit would expect its pre-tax cash flow to initially decrease.", "Ford Credit’s pre-tax cash flow sensitivity to interest rate movement at December 31 was as follows (in millions):", "One percentage point instantaneous increase in interest rates", "One percentage point instantaneous decrease in interest rates", "While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credit’s best estimate of the impacts of the specified assumed interest rate scenarios, its actual results could differ from those projected.", "The model Ford Credit uses to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions.", "Embedded in the model are assumptions regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, replacement of maturing derivatives, exercise of options embedded in debt and derivatives, and predicted repayment of retail financing and operating lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity.", "Ford Credit’s repayment projections ahead of contractual maturity are based on historical experience.", "If interest rates or other factors change, Ford Credit’s actual prepayment experience could be different than projected.", "Foreign Currency Risk.", "Ford Credit’s policy is to minimize exposure to changes in currency exchange rates.", "To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit borrows in a variety of currencies, principally U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, euros, sterling, and renminbi.", "Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables.", "When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements.", "When a different currency is used, Ford Credit may use foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards to convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables.", "As a result of this policy, Ford Credit believes its market risk exposure, relating to changes in currency exchange rates at December 31, 2023, is insignificant.", "Derivative Fair Values.", "The net fair value of Ford Credit’s derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2023 was a liability of $1.3 billion, compared to a liability of $2.0 billion at December 31, 2022.", "Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract.", "We enter into master agreements with counterparties that allow netting of certain exposures in order to manage this risk.", "Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, and commodity price risk.", "We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification.", "Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward-looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions before risks become losses.", "Exposure limits are established based on our overall risk tolerance, which is calculated from counterparty credit ratings and market-based credit default swap (“CDS”) spreads.", "The exposure limits are lower for smaller and lower-rated counterparties, counterparties that have relatively higher CDS spreads, and for longer dated exposures.", "Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and included in periodic reports to our Treasurer.", "Substantially all of our counterparty exposures are with counterparties that have an investment grade rating.", "Investment grade is our guideline for minimum counterparty long-term ratings.", "The Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, our Financial Statements, the accompanying Notes to the Financial Statements, and the Financial Statement Schedule that are filed as part of this Report are listed under", "“Item 15.", "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules” and are set forth beginning on page 105 immediately following the signature pages of this

control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external

"Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or because the degree of compliance

maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.", "We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.", "Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.", "Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.", "Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.", "Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.", "Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of

opinions.", "Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting", "A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.", "A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.",

the balance sheet date.", "For consumer receivables that share similar risk characteristics, management estimates the lifetime expected credit losses based on a collective assessment using measurement models and management judgment.", "The lifetime expected credit losses for the receivables is determined by applying probability of default and loss given default assumptions to monthly expected exposures, then discounting these cash flows to present value using the receivable’s original effective interest rate or the current effective interest rate for a variable rate receivable.", "If management does not believe the models reflect lifetime expected credit losses for the portfolio, an adjustment is made to reflect management judgment regarding qualitative factors including economic uncertainty, observable changes in portfolio performance, and other relevant factors.", "The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Ford Credit consumer finance receivables allowance for credit losses is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in determining the consumer finance receivables allowance for credit losses; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the probability of default and loss given default assumptions and management’s judgment regarding qualitative factors; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.", "Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.", "These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls

of claims for each model year.", "Management reevaluates the adequacy of their accruals on a regular basis.", "The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the warranty accrual for the United States is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in the estimation of the accrual and development of the patterned estimation model; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the estimation model and significant assumptions related to the frequency and average cost of claims; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.", "Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in

conditions and consumer trends that originated during the pandemic continue to persist and may also have long-lasting adverse impact on us and our industries independently of the progress of the pandemic.", "For example, pandemic-related issues have exacerbated port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays, resulting in additional expenses to expedite delivery of critical parts.", "Similarly, increased demand for personal electronics has created a shortfall of semiconductors, which has caused challenges in our supply chain and production.", "In addition, labor shortages resulting from the pandemic, including worker absenteeism, has led to increased difficulty in hiring and retaining manufacturing and service workers, as well as increased labor costs and supplier delays.", "Sustaining our production trajectory will require the ongoing readiness and solvency of our suppliers and vendors, a stable and motivated production workforce and government cooperation, including for travel and visa allowances.", "The contingencies inherent in the ramp at new facilities such as Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas may be exacerbated by these challenges.", "Additionally, infection rates and regulations continue to fluctuate in various regions, which may impact operations.", "For example, in 2022, spikes in COVID-19 cases in Shanghai resulted in the temporary shutdown of Gigafactory Shanghai, as well as parts of our supply chain, and impacted our ability to deliver cars.", "We cannot predict the duration or direction of current global trends or their sustained impact.", "Ultimately, we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, and attempt to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources accordingly.", "Lastly, rising interest rates may lead to consumers to increasingly pull back spending, including on our products, which may harm our demand, business and operating results.", "If we experience unfavorable global market conditions, or if we cannot or do not maintain operations at a scope that is commensurate with such conditions or are later required to or choose to suspend such operations again, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.", "We have previously experienced and may in the future experience launch and production ramp delays for new products and features.", "For example, we encountered unanticipated supplier issues that led to delays during the initial ramp of our first Model X and experienced challenges with a supplier and with ramping full automation for certain of our initial Model 3 manufacturing processes.", "In", "addition, we may introduce in the future new or unique manufacturing processes and design features for our products.", "There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully and timely introduce and scale such processes or features.", "In particular, our future business depends in large part on increasing the production of mass-market vehicles including Model 3 and Model Y.", "In order to be successful, we will need to implement, maintain and ramp efficient and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains and achieve the design tolerances, high quality and output rates we have planned at our manufacturing facilities in California, Nevada, Texas, China, Germany and any future sites.", "We will also need to hire, train and compensate skilled employees to operate these facilities.", "Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such as those we experienced in the past may arise during our production ramps, and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing processes and reducing costs.", "If we are not successful in achieving these goals, we could face delays in establishing and/or sustaining our Model 3 and Model Y ramps or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets.", "We have experienced, and may also experience similar future delays in launching and/or ramping production of our energy storage products and Solar Roof; new product versions or variants; new vehicles; and future features and services based on artificial intelligence.", "Likewise, we may encounter delays with the design, construction and regulatory or other approvals necessary to build and bring online future manufacturing facilities and products.", "Any delay or other complication in ramping the production of our current products or the development, manufacture, launch and production ramp of our future products, features and services, or in doing so cost-effectively and with high quality, may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.", "Our products contain thousands of parts purchased globally from hundreds of suppliers, including single-source direct suppliers, which exposes us to multiple potential sources of component shortages.", "Unexpected changes in business conditions, materials pricing, including inflation of raw material costs, labor issues, wars, trade policies, natural disasters, health epidemics such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, trade and shipping disruptions, port congestions and other factors beyond our or our suppliers’ control could also affect these suppliers’ ability to deliver components to us or to remain solvent and operational.", "For example, a global shortage of semiconductors has been reported since early 2021 and has caused challenges in the manufacturing industry and impacted our supply chain and production.", "In addition, a spike in COVID-19 cases in Shanghai in early 2022 led to temporary manufacturing shutdowns of certain of our suppliers.", "We have used alternative parts and programmed software to mitigate certain challenges caused by these shortages, but there is no guarantee we may be able to continually do so as we scale production to meet our growth targets.", "Additionally, if our suppliers do not accurately forecast and effectively allocate production or if they are not willing to allocate sufficient production to us, it may reduce our access to components and require us to search for new suppliers.", "The unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delays, idle manufacturing facilities, product design changes and loss of access to important technology and tools for producing and supporting our products, as well as impact our capacity expansion and our ability to fulfill our obligations under customer contracts.", "Moreover, significant increases in our production, such as for Model 3 and Model Y, or product design changes by us have required and may in the future require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time.", "We have faced in the past, and may face suppliers who are unwilling or unable to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost, quality and volume needs, or to do so may cost us more, which may require us to replace them with other sources.", "Finally, we have limited vehicle manufacturing experience outside of the Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Shanghai and we may experience issues increasing the level of localized procurement at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas.", "While we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources or develop our own replacements for most of our components, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly or at all.", "Additionally, we may be unsuccessful in our continuous efforts to negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid unfavorable changes to terms, source less expensive suppliers for certain parts and redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce, especially in light of the increases in materials pricing.", "Any of these occurrences may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.", "As the scale of our vehicle production increases, we will also need to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport components at high volumes to our manufacturing facilities and servicing locations internationally.", "If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation, inventory", "management and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain and parts management, we may incur unexpected production disruption, storage, transportation and write-off costs, which may harm our business and operating results.", "Our ability to increase production of our vehicles on a sustained basis, make them affordable globally by accessing local supply chains and workforces and streamline delivery logistics is dependent on the construction and ramp of our current and future factories.", "The construction of and commencement and ramp of production at these factories are subject to a number of uncertainties inherent in all new manufacturing operations, including ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements, procurement and maintenance of construction, environmental and operational licenses and approvals for additional expansion, supply chain constraints, hiring, training and retention of qualified employees and the pace of bringing production equipment and processes online with the capability to manufacture high-quality units at scale.", "Moreover, we will have to establish and ramp production of our proprietary battery cells and packs at our new factories, and we additionally intend to incorporate sequential design and manufacturing changes into vehicles manufactured at each new factory.", "If we experience any issues or delays in meeting our projected timelines, costs, capital efficiency and production capacity for our new factories, expanding and managing teams to implement iterative design and production changes there, maintaining and complying with the terms of any debt financing that we obtain to fund them or generating and maintaining demand for the vehicles we manufacture there, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition may be harmed.", "Our success will depend on our ability to continue to expand our sales capabilities.", "We are targeting with Model 3 and Model Y a global mass demographic with a broad range of potential customers, in which we have relatively limited experience projecting demand and pricing our products.", "We currently produce numerous international variants at a limited number of factories, and if our specific demand expectations for these variants prove inaccurate, we may not be able to timely generate deliveries matched to the vehicles that we produce in the same timeframe or that are commensurate with the size of our operations in a given region.", "Likewise, as we develop and grow our energy products and services worldwide, our success will depend on our ability to correctly forecast demand in various markets.", "Because we do not have independent dealer networks, we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicles to our customers.", "As our production volumes continue to grow, we have faced in the past, and may face challenges with deliveries at increasing volumes, particularly in international markets requiring significant transit times.", "We have also deployed a number of delivery models, such as deliveries to customers’ homes and workplaces and touchless deliveries, but there is no guarantee that such models will be scalable or be accepted globally.", "Likewise, as we ramp our energy products, we are working to substantially increase our production and installation capabilities.", "If we experience production delays or inaccurately forecast demand, our business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.", "Moreover, because of our unique expertise with our vehicles, we recommend that our vehicles be serviced by us or by certain authorized professionals.", "If we experience delays in adding servicing capacity or servicing our vehicles efficiently, or experience unforeseen issues with the reliability of our vehicles, particularly higher-volume additions to our fleet such as Model 3 and Model Y, it could overburden our servicing capabilities and parts inventory.", "Similarly, the increasing number of Tesla vehicles also requires us to continue to rapidly increase the number of our Supercharger stations and connectors throughout the world.", "There is no assurance that we will be able to ramp our business to meet our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and vehicle charging targets globally, that our projections on which such targets are based will prove accurate or that the pace of growth or coverage of our customer infrastructure network will meet customer expectations.", "These plans require significant cash investments and management resources and there is no guarantee that they will generate additional sales or installations of our products, or that we will be able to avoid cost overruns or be able to hire additional personnel to support them.", "As we expand, we will also need to ensure our compliance with regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions applicable to the sale, installation and servicing of our products, the sale or dispatch of electricity related to our energy products and the operation of Superchargers.", "If we fail to manage our growth effectively, it may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.", "We are dependent on the continued supply of lithium-ion battery cells for our vehicles and energy storage products, and we will require substantially more cells to grow our business according to our plans.", "Currently, we rely on suppliers such as Panasonic and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) for these cells.", "We have to date fully qualified only a very limited number of such suppliers and have limited flexibility in changing suppliers.", "Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from our suppliers could", "limit production of our vehicles and energy storage products.", "In the long term, we intend to supplement cells from our suppliers with cells manufactured by us, which we believe will be more efficient, manufacturable at greater volumes and more cost-effective", "than currently available cells.", "However, our efforts to develop and manufacture such battery cells have required, and may continue to require, significant investments, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these targets in the timeframes that we have planned or at all.", "If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail our planned vehicle and energy storage product production or procure additional cells from suppliers at potentially greater costs, either of which may harm our business and operating results.", "In addition, the cost and mass production of battery cells, whether manufactured by our suppliers or by us, depends in part upon the prices and availability of raw materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and/or other metals.", "The prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials.", "For example, as a result of increased global production of electric vehicles and energy storage products, suppliers of these raw materials may be unable to meet our volume needs.", "Additionally, our suppliers may not be willing or able to reliably meet our timelines or our cost and quality needs, which may require us to replace them with other sources.", "Any reduced availability of these materials may impact our access to cells and our growth, and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup such costs through increased prices.", "Moreover, our inability to meet demand and any product price increases may harm our brand, growth, prospects and operating results.", "Though we continue to see increased interest and adoption of electric vehicles, if the market for electric vehicles in general and Tesla vehicles in particular does not develop as we expect, develops more slowly than we expect, or if demand for our vehicles decreases in our markets or our vehicles compete with each other, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.", "In addition, electric vehicles still constitute a small percentage of overall vehicle sales.", "As a result, the market for our vehicles could be negatively affected by numerous factors, such as:", "perceptions about electric vehicle features, quality, safety, performance and cost;", "perceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge, and access to charging facilities;", "competition, including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and high fuel-economy internal combustion engine vehicles;", "volatility in the cost of oil, gasoline and energy, such as wide fluctuations in crude oil prices during 2020;", "government regulations and economic incentives and conditions; and", "Finally, the target demographics for our vehicles, particularly Model 3 and Model Y, are highly competitive.", "Sales of vehicles in the automotive industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to further volatility.", "The worldwide automotive market is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future.", "For example, Model 3 and Model Y face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive entry-level premium sedan and compact SUV markets.", "A significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are reported to have plans to enter, the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, as well as the market for self-driving technology and other vehicle applications and software platforms.", "In some cases, our competitors offer or will offer electric vehicles in important markets such as China and Europe, and/or have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future.", "Many of our competitors have significantly more or better-established resources than we do to devote to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products.", "Increased competition could result in our lower vehicle unit sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.", "We also face competition in our energy generation and storage business from other manufacturers, developers, installers and service providers of competing energy technologies, as well as from large utilities.", "Decreases in the retail or wholesale prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of customer defaults.", "Our plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicles and energy storage products depends on significant lithium-ion battery cell production, including by our partner Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada.", "We also produce several vehicle components at our Gigafactories, such as battery modules and packs and drive units, and manufacture energy storage products.", "In the past, some of the manufacturing lines for certain product components took longer than anticipated to ramp to their full capacity, and additional bottlenecks may arise in the future as we continue to increase the production rate and introduce new lines.", "In addition, as the IRA provides new incentives for domestic energy production and manufacturing, we may face increasing competition from other automobile manufacturers as well as suppliers for the resources and capacity to build additional factories and expand our operations domestically.", "If we are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operations, or if we are unable to do so cost-effectively or hire and retain highly-skilled personnel there, our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be limited, which may harm our business and operating results.", "Finally, the high volumes of lithium-ion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured by us and by our suppliers are stored and recycled at our various facilities.", "Any mishandling of these products may cause disruption to the operation of such facilities.", "While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations.", "Any such disruptions or issues may harm our brand and business.", "We are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, political uncertainty and social, environmental and economic conditions in numerous jurisdictions, including markets in which we generate significant sales, over which we have little control and which are inherently unpredictable.", "Our operations in such jurisdictions, particularly as a company based in the U.S., create risks relating to conforming our products to regulatory and safety requirements and charging and other electric infrastructures; organizing local operating entities; establishing, staffing and managing foreign business locations; attracting local customers; navigating foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements; enforceability of our contractual rights; trade restrictions, customs regulations, tariffs and price or exchange controls; and preferences in foreign nations for domestically manufactured products.", "Such conditions may increase our costs, impact our ability to sell our products and require significant management attention, and may harm our business if we are unable to manage them effectively.", "If our products contain design or manufacturing defects that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair, or certain features of our vehicles such as new Autopilot or FSD features take longer than expected to become enabled, are legally restricted or become subject to onerous regulation, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and services may be harmed, and we may experience delivery delays, product recalls, product liability, breach of warranty and consumer protection claims and significant warranty and other expenses.", "There is no guarantee that any incremental changes in the specific equipment we deploy in our vehicles over time will not result in initial functional disparities from prior iterations or will perform as expected in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all.", "Our products are also highly dependent on software, which is inherently complex and may contain latent defects or errors or be subject to external attacks.", "Issues experienced by our customers have included those related to taillights, seat belt chimes and display screens in certain Tesla models.", "Although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible, such efforts may not be timely, may hamper production or may not completely satisfy our customers.", "While we have performed, and continue to perform, extensive internal testing on our products and features, we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate their long-term quality, reliability, durability and performance characteristics.", "There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in our products prior to their sale to or installation for customers.", "The automobile industry generally experiences significant product liability claims, and as such we face the risk of such claims in the event our vehicles do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected.", "As is true for other automakers, our vehicles have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in accidents resulting in death or personal injury, and such accidents where Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot or FSD Capability features are engaged are the subject of significant public attention, especially in light of NHTSA’s Standing General Order requiring reports regarding crashes involving vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems.", "We have experienced, and we expect to continue to face, claims and regulatory scrutiny arising from or related to misuse or", "claimed failures or alleged misrepresentations of such new technologies that we are pioneering.", "In addition, the battery packs that we produce make use of lithium-ion cells.", "On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting", "smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells.", "While we have designed our battery packs to passively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells, there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, in particular due to a high-speed crash.", "Likewise, as our solar energy systems and energy storage products generate and store electricity, they have the potential to fail or cause injury to people or property.", "Any product liability claim may subject us to lawsuits and substantial monetary damages, product recalls or redesign efforts, and even a meritless claim may require us to defend it, all of which may generate negative publicity and be expensive and time-consuming.", "In most jurisdictions, we generally self-insure against the risk of product liability claims for vehicle exposure, meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds and not by insurance.", "In order to maintain and grow our business, we must maintain credibility and confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts, investors, ratings agencies and other parties in our long-term financial viability and business prospects.", "Maintaining such confidence may be challenging due to our limited operating history relative to established competitors; customer unfamiliarity with our products; any delays we may experience in scaling manufacturing, delivery and service operations to meet demand; competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services; our quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations; and other factors including those over which we have no control.", "In particular, Tesla’s products, business, results of operations, and statements and actions of Tesla and its management are well-publicized by a range of third parties.", "Such attention can include criticism, which may be exaggerated or unfounded, such as speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management team.", "Any such negative perceptions, whether caused by us or not, may harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed.", "We offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in North America, Europe and Asia primarily ourselves and through various financial institutions.", "We also currently offer vehicle financing arrangements directly through our local subsidiaries in certain markets.", "Depending on the country, such arrangements are available for specified models and may include operating leases directly with us under which we typically receive only a very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease, followed by a stream of payments over the term of the lease.", "We have also offered various arrangements for customers of our solar energy systems whereby they pay us a fixed payment to lease or finance the purchase of such systems or purchase electricity generated by them.", "If we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national, state and/or local financial regulations and consumer protection laws governing these transactions, we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties.", "The profitability of any directly-leased vehicles returned to us at the end of their leases depends on our ability to accurately project our vehicles’ residual values at the outset of the leases, and such values may fluctuate prior to the end of their terms depending on various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles, economic cycles and the pricing of new vehicles.", "We have made in the past and may make in the future certain adjustments to our prices from time to time in the ordinary course of business, which may impact the residual values of our vehicles and reduce the profitability of our vehicle leasing program.", "The funding and growth of this program also rely on our ability to secure adequate financing and/or business partners.", "If we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program through internal funds, partners or other financing sources, and compelling alternative financing programs are not available for our customers who may expect or need such options, we may be unable to grow our vehicle deliveries.", "Furthermore, if our vehicle leasing business grows substantially, our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the resulting greater levels of residual risk.", "Similarly, we have provided resale value guarantees to vehicle customers and partners for certain financing programs, under which such counterparties may sell their vehicles back to us at certain points in time at pre-determined amounts.", "However, actual resale values are subject to fluctuations over the term of the financing arrangements, such as from the vehicle pricing changes discussed above.", "If the actual resale values of any vehicles resold or returned to us pursuant to these programs are materially lower than the pre- determined amounts we have offered, our financial condition and operating results may be harmed.", "Finally, our vehicle and solar energy system financing programs and our energy storage sales programs also expose us to customer credit risk.", "In the event of a widespread economic downturn or other catastrophic event, our customers may be unable or unwilling to satisfy their payment obligations to us on a timely basis or at all.", "If a significant number of our customers default, we may incur substantial credit losses and/or impairment charges with respect to the underlying assets.", "We are party to an operating lease and a research and development agreement through the State University of New York (the “SUNY Foundation”).", "These agreements provide for the construction and use of our Gigafactory New York, which we have primarily used for the development and production of our Solar Roof and other solar products and components, energy storage components and Supercharger components, and for other lessor-approved functions.", "Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during a period that was initially 10 years beginning April 30, 2018.", "As of December 31, 2022, we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo.", "While we expect to have and grow significant operations at Gigafactory New York and the surrounding Buffalo area, any failure by us in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet all applicable future obligations may result in our obligation to pay a “program payment” of $41 million to the SUNY Foundation for such year, the termination of our lease at Gigafactory New York which may require us to pay additional penalties, and/or the need to adjust certain of our operations, in particular our production ramp of the Solar Roof or other components.", "Any of the foregoing events may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.", "The loss of the services of any of our key employees or any significant portion of our workforce could disrupt our operations or delay the development, introduction and ramp of our products and services.", "In particular, we are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer.", "None of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business.", "Our future success also depends upon our ability to attract, hire and retain a large number of engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and delivery, service, installation, technology and support personnel, especially to support our planned high-volume product sales, market and geographical expansion and technological innovations.", "If we are not successful in managing these risks, our business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.", "Employees may leave Tesla or choose other employers over Tesla due to various factors, such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive or technology experience, or any negative publicity related to us.", "In regions where we have or will have operations, particularly significant engineering and manufacturing centers, there is strong competition for individuals with skillsets needed for our business, including specialized knowledge of electric vehicles, engineering and electrical and building construction expertise.", "Moreover, we may be impacted by perceptions relating to reductions in force that we have conducted in the past in order to optimize our organizational structure and reduce costs and the departure of certain senior personnel for various reasons.", "We also compete with both mature and prosperous companies that have far greater financial resources than we do and start-ups and emerging companies that promise short-term growth opportunities.", "Finally, our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origins, with an emphasis on equity-based awards and benefits in order to closely align their incentives with the long-term interests of our stockholders.", "We periodically seek and obtain approval from our stockholders for future increases to the number of awards available under our equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans.", "If we are unable to obtain the requisite stockholder approvals for such future increases, we may have to expend additional cash to compensate our employees and our ability to retain and hire qualified personnel may be harmed.", "We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer.", "Although Mr.", "Musk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla.", "Mr. Musk also currently serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer of Space Exploration Technologies Corp., a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles, Chief Executive Officer of Twitter, Inc., a social media company, and is involved in other emerging technology ventures.", "We continue to expand our information technology systems as our operations grow, such as product data management, procurement, inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management, financial, tax and regulatory compliance systems.", "This includes the implementation of new internally developed systems and the deployment of such systems in the U.S. and abroad.", "While, we maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against intellectual property theft, data breaches, sabotage and other external or internal cyber-attacks or misappropriation, our systems and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to malware, ransomware, viruses, denial-of-service attacks, phishing attacks, social engineering, computer hacking, unauthorized access, exploitation of bugs, defects and vulnerabilities, breakdowns, damage, interruptions, system malfunctions, power outages, terrorism, acts of vandalism, security breaches, security incidents, inadvertent or intentional actions by employees or other third parties, and other cyber-attacks.", "To the extent any security incident results in unauthorized access or damage to or acquisition, use, corruption, loss, destruction, alteration or dissemination of our data, including intellectual property and personal information, or our products or vehicles, or for it to be believed or reported that any of these occurred, it could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with applicable data breach notification laws, subject us to time consuming, distracting and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations and contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information.", "This could result in increased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure and/or reputational harm.", "We also rely on service providers, and similar incidents relating to their information technology systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business.", "There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks.", "Our service providers, including our workforce management software provider, have been subject to ransomware and other security incidents, and we cannot guarantee that our or our service providers’ systems have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in a security incident, or other disruption to, our or our service providers’ systems.", "Our ability to monitor our service providers’ security measures is limited, and, in any event, malicious third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures.", "Further, the implementation, maintenance, segregation and improvement of these systems require significant management time, support and cost, and there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems and updating current systems, including disruptions to the related areas of business operation.", "These risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory, procure parts or supplies or manufacture, sell, deliver and service products, adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain compliance with, or realize available benefits under, tax laws and other applicable regulations.", "Moreover, if we do not successfully implement, maintain or expand these systems as planned, our operations may be disrupted, our ability to accurately and/or timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting, which may impact our ability to certify our financial results.", "Moreover, our proprietary information, including intellectual property and personal information, could be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected.", "If these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to, we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions.", "Our products contain complex information technology systems.", "For example, our vehicles and energy storage products are designed with built-in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update their functionality.", "While we have implemented security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks, our products and their systems, malicious entities have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such networks, products and systems to gain control of, or to change, our products’ functionality, user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our products.", "We encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our products through our security vulnerability reporting policy, and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability.", "However, there can be no assurance that any vulnerabilities will not be exploited before they can be identified, or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful.", "Any unauthorized access to or control of our products or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or government investigations.", "In addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our products, their systems or data, as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our products, their systems or data are capable of being hacked, may harm our brand, prospects and operating results.", "We have been the subject of such reports in the past.", "It is not uncommon for employees of certain trades at companies such as ours to belong to a union, which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages.", "Moreover, regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the U.S. mandate employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect to the relevant companies’ operations.", "Although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employees, they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union, or we may be required to become a union signatory.", "From time to time, labor unions have engaged in campaigns to organize certain of our operations, as part of which such unions have filed unfair labor practice charges against us with the National Labor Relations Board (the “NLRB”), and they may do so in the future.", "In September 2019, an administrative law judge issued a recommended decision for Tesla on certain issues and against us on certain others.", "In March 2021, the NLRB adopted a portion of the recommendation and overturned others.", "Tesla appealed the decision to the United States Circuit Court for the Fifth Circuit, which is currently pending.", "Any unfavorable ultimate outcome for Tesla may have a negative impact on the perception of Tesla’s treatment of our employees.", "Furthermore, we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as suppliers and trucking and freight companies.", "Any work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and may harm our business and operating results.", "As a manufacturing company, we must manage the risk of product recalls with respect to our products.", "Recalls for our vehicles have resulted from various hardware and software-related safety defect or non-compliance determinations.", "In addition to recalls initiated by us for various causes, testing of or investigations into our products by government regulators or industry groups may compel us to initiate product recalls or may result in negative public perceptions about the safety of our products, even if we disagree with the defect determination or have data that contradicts it.", "In the future, we may voluntarily or involuntarily initiate recalls if any of our products are determined by us or a regulator to contain a safety defect or be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations, such as U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.", "Such recalls, whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers, could result in significant expense, supply chain complications and service burdens, and may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.", "We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell.", "We also provide certain warranties with respect to the energy generation and storage systems we sell, including on their installation and maintenance.", "For components not manufactured by us, we generally pass through to our customers the applicable manufacturers’ warranties, but may retain some warranty responsibilities for some or all of the life of such components.", "As part of our energy generation and storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that guarantee that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or other energy performance requirements specified in the contract.", "Under these performance guarantees, we generally bear the risk of electricity production or other performance shortfalls, including in some cases shortfalls caused by failures in components from third party manufacturers.", "These risks are exacerbated in the event such manufacturers cease operations or fail to honor their warranties.", "If our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products, our financial condition and operating results may be harmed.", "Warranty reserves include our management’s best estimates of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty, which are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims.", "Such estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience, especially with respect to products that we have introduced relatively recently and/or that we expect to produce at significantly greater volumes than our past products, may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future.", "We may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and other claims against us, for which we may have no insurance coverage.", "As a general matter, we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do, and in some cases, we do not maintain any at all.", "Additionally, the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles or self-insured retentions, policy limitations and exclusions, and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us.", "A loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts, which may harm our financial condition and operating results.", "The terms of certain of our debt facilities contain, and any of our other future debt agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business, including restrictions on our and/or our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional debt or create liens.", "In addition, under certain circumstances we are required to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio.", "As a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and engage in beneficial transactions, including to obtain additional financing as needed, may be restricted.", "Furthermore, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements, which could permit the holders to accelerate our obligation to repay the debt.", "If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it.", "Our business and our future plans for expansion are capital-intensive, and the specific timing of cash inflows and outflows may fluctuate substantially from period to period.", "We may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity- related or debt securities or through obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund, together with our principal sources of liquidity, the costs of developing and manufacturing our current or future products, to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments, or to refinance our significant consolidated indebtedness, even if not required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness.", "We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all.", "If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.", "We depreciate the cost of our manufacturing equipment over their expected useful lives.", "However, product cycles or manufacturing technology may change periodically, and we may decide to update our products or manufacturing processes more quickly than expected.", "Moreover, improvements in engineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency may result in our ability to manufacture our products using less of our currently installed equipment.", "Alternatively, as we ramp and mature the production of our products to higher levels, we may discontinue the use of already installed equipment in favor of different or additional equipment.", "The useful life of any equipment that would be retired early as a result would be shortened, causing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated, and our results of operations may be harmed.", "As of December 31, 2022, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $2.06 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness (see Note 11, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).", "Our consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions.", "We and our subsidiaries may, subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness, incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt.", "Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due, to make payments upon conversion or repurchase demands with respect to our convertible senior notes or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or desire, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control.", "Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur, and to make necessary capital expenditures.", "If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive.", "Our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time.", "In addition, our ability to make payments may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness.", "We may not be able to engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all, which may result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness and harm our financial condition and operating results.", "We transact business globally in multiple currencies and have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue, operating expenses and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, currently primarily the Chinese yuan, euro, pound sterling and Norwegian krone.", "To the extent we have significant revenues denominated in such foreign currencies, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in U.S. dollars, as we have historically experienced, and are currently experiencing.", "In addition, a portion of our costs and expenses have been, and we anticipate will continue to be, denominated in foreign currencies, including the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen.", "If we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the U.S. dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies, our costs as measured in U.S. dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer.", "Moreover, while we undertake limited hedging activities intended to offset the impact of currency translation exposure, it is impossible to predict or eliminate such impact.", "As a result, our operating results may be harmed.", "Our competitors or other third parties may hold or obtain patents, copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary rights that could prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, develop, sell or market our products and services, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business.", "From time to time, the holders of such intellectual property rights may assert their rights and urge us to take licenses and/or may bring suits alleging infringement or misappropriation of such rights, which could result in substantial costs, negative publicity and management attention, regardless of merit.", "While we endeavor to obtain and protect the intellectual property rights that we expect will allow us to retain or advance our strategic initiatives, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately identify and protect the portions of intellectual property that are strategic to our business, or mitigate the risk of potential suits or other legal demands by our competitors.", "Accordingly, we may consider the entering into licensing agreements with respect to such rights, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur, and such licenses and associated litigation could significantly increase our operating expenses.", "In addition, if we are determined to have or believe there is a high likelihood that we have infringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease making, selling or incorporating certain components or intellectual property into the goods and services we offer, to pay substantial damages and/or license royalties, to redesign our products and services and/or to establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services.", "In the event that we are required to take one or more such actions, our brand, business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.", "Companies across many industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices.", "Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the non-financial impacts of their investments.", "While our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy, if our ESG practices do not meet investor or other industry stakeholder expectations, which continue to evolve, we may incur additional costs and our brand, ability to attract and retain qualified employees and business may be harmed.", "We may be impacted by natural disasters, wars, health epidemics, weather conditions, the long-term effects of climate change, power outages or other events outside of our control.", "For example, our Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Nevada are located in seismically active regions in Northern California and Nevada, and our Gigafactory Shanghai is located in a flood-prone area.", "Moreover, the area in which our Gigafactory Texas is located experienced severe winter storms in the first quarter of 2021 that had a widespread impact on utilities and transportation.", "If major disasters such as earthquakes, floods or other climate-related events occur, or our information system or communication breaks down or operates improperly, our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged, or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products.", "In addition, the global COVID-19 pandemic has impacted economic markets, manufacturing operations, supply chains, employment and consumer behavior in nearly every geographic region and industry across the world, and we have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected as a result.", "Also, the broader consequences in the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which may include further embargoes, regional instability and geopolitical shifts; airspace bans relating to certain routes, or strategic decisions to alter certain routes; and potential retaliatory action by the Russian government against companies, and the extent of the conflict on our business and operating results cannot be predicted.", "We may incur expenses or delays relating to such events outside of our control, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.", "Government and economic incentives that support the development and adoption of electric vehicles in the U.S. and abroad, including certain tax exemptions, tax credits and rebates, may be reduced, eliminated or exhausted from time to time.", "For example, previously available incentives favoring electric vehicles in areas including Ontario, Canada, Netherlands, Italy, Hong Kong and California have expired or were cancelled or temporarily unavailable, and in some cases were not eventually replaced or reinstituted, which may have negatively impacted sales.", "Certain government and economic incentives, similar to the IRA, may also be implemented that provide benefits to manufacturers who assemble domestically, have local suppliers or have other characteristics that may not apply to Tesla.", "Such developments could negatively impact demand for our vehicles, and we and our customers may have to adjust to them, including through pricing modifications.", "In addition, certain governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy storage product businesses allow us to lower our costs and encourage customers to buy our products and investors to invest in our solar financing funds.", "However, these incentives may expire when the allocated funding is exhausted, reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase, sometimes without warning.", "Likewise, in jurisdictions where net metering is currently available, our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy that their solar energy systems generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use.", "The benefit available under net metering has been or has been proposed to be reduced, altered or eliminated in several jurisdictions, and has also been contested and may continue to be contested before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.", "Any reductions or terminations of such incentives may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results by making our products less competitive for customers, increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract investment partners and to form new financing funds for our solar and energy storage assets.", "Finally, we and our fund investors claim these U.S. federal tax credits and certain state incentives in amounts based on independently appraised fair market values of our solar and energy storage systems.", "Some governmental authorities have audited such values and in certain cases have determined that these values should be lower, and they may do so again in the future.", "Such determinations may result in adverse tax consequences and/or our obligation to make indemnification or other payments to our funds or fund investors.", "As we grow our manufacturing operations in additional regions, we are or will be subject to complex environmental, manufacturing, health and safety laws and regulations at numerous jurisdictional levels in the U.S., China, Germany and other locations abroad, including laws relating to the use, handling, storage, recycling, disposal and/or human exposure to hazardous materials, product material inputs and post-consumer products and with respect to constructing, expanding and maintaining our facilities.", "New, or changes in, environmental and climate change laws, regulations or rules could also lead to increased costs of compliance, including remediations of any discovered issues, and changes to our operations, which may be significant, and any failures to comply could result in significant expenses, delays or fines.", "In addition, as we have increased our employee headcount and operations, we are and may continue to be subject to increased scrutiny, including litigation and government investigations relating to allegations such as discrimination and workplace misconduct, that we will need to defend against.", "If we are unable to successfully defend ourselves in such litigation or government investigations, it may harm our brand, ability to attract and retain qualified employees, business and financial condition.", "We are also subject to laws and regulations applicable to the supply, manufacture, import, sale, service and performance of our products both domestically and abroad.", "For example, in countries outside of the U.S., we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety, fuel economy and emissions that are often materially different from equivalent requirements in the U.S., thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in all countries.", "This process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry, as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems requirements.", "In particular, we offer in our vehicles in certain markets Autopilot and FSD Capability features that today assist drivers with certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel, but which currently require drivers to remain fully engaged in the driving operation.", "We are continuing to develop our Autopilot and FSD Capability technology.", "There are a variety of international, federal and state regulations that may apply to, and may adversely affect, the design and performance, sale, registration and operation of Autopilot and FSD Capability, and future capability, including full self-driving vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver.", "This includes many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to apply to vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver.", "Such regulations continue to rapidly change, which increases the likelihood of a patchwork of complex or conflicting regulations, or may delay, restrict or prohibit the availability of certain functionalities and vehicle designs, which could adversely affect our business.", "Finally, as a manufacturer, installer and service provider with respect to solar generation and energy storage systems, a supplier of electricity generated and stored by certain of the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers, and a provider of", "grid services through virtual power plant models, we are impacted by federal, state and local regulations and policies concerning the import or export of components, electricity pricing, the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electrical grid and the sale of electricity generated by third party-owned systems.", "If regulations and policies are introduced that adversely impact the import or export of components, or the interconnection, maintenance or use of our solar and energy storage systems, they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage products and services, threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and services in the relevant jurisdictions, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.", "Any failure by us or our vendor or other business partners to comply with our public privacy notice or with federal, state or international privacy, data protection or security laws or regulations relating to the processing, collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions against us, legal liability, fines, damages, ongoing audit requirements and other significant costs.", "Substantial expenses and operational changes may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws, and even an unsuccessful challenge by customers or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us.", "In addition, certain emerging privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their interpretation, application and impact, and may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation.", "For example, the General Data Protection Regulation applies to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the European Union, and has created new compliance obligations and significantly increased fines for noncompliance.", "Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act imposes certain legal obligations on our use and processing of personal information related to California residents.", "Finally, new privacy and cybersecurity laws have come into effect in China.", "In addition to the risks related to general privacy regulation, we may also be subject to specific vehicle manufacturer obligations relating to cybersecurity, data privacy and data localization requirements which place additional risks to our international operations.", "Risks and penalties could include ongoing audit requirements, data protection authority investigations, legal proceedings by international governmental entities or others resulting in mandated disclosure of sensitive data or other commercially unfavorable terms.", "Notwithstanding our efforts to protect the security and integrity of our customers’ personal information, we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if, for example, third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to customers’ personal information.", "A major breach of our network security and systems may result in fines, penalties and damages and harm our brand, prospects and operating results.", "We are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To our knowledge, no government agency in any such ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred.", "However, we cannot predict the outcome or impact of any such ongoing matters, and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future.", "Moreover, we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas, and if instituted, in defending against any governmental proceedings.", "For example, on October 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment approving the terms of a settlement filed with the Court on September 29, 2018, in connection with the actions taken by the SEC relating to Mr. Musk’s statement on August 7, 2018 that he was considering taking Tesla private.", "Pursuant to the settlement, we, among other things, paid a civil penalty of $20 million, appointed an independent director as the chair of our board of directors, appointed two additional independent directors to our board of directors and made further enhancements to our disclosure controls and other corporate governance-related matters.", "On April 26, 2019, this settlement was amended to clarify certain of the previously-agreed disclosure procedures, which was subsequently approved by the Court.", "All other terms of the prior settlement were reaffirmed without modification.", "Although we intend to continue to comply with the terms and requirements of the settlement, if there is a lack of compliance or an alleged lack of compliance, additional enforcement actions or other legal proceedings may be instituted against us.", "While we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies, including sales through our website, we may not be able to sell our vehicles through our own stores in certain states in the U.S. with laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this direct-to-consumer sales model.", "It has also been asserted that the laws in some states limit our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators, and such assertions persist.", "In certain locations, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles have been, and may be, challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws.", "We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state franchise laws were not intended to apply to a manufacturer that does not have franchise dealers anywhere in the world.", "In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that, if enacted, would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model.", "A few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate, but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate.", "The application of state laws applicable to our operations continues to be difficult to predict.", "Internationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices.", "Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time.", "Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers may harm our financial condition and operating results.", "Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock", "The trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control.", "Our common stock has experienced over the last 52 weeks an intra-day trading high of $384.29 per share and a low of $101.81 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the three-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend in August 2022 (the “2022 Stock Split”).", "The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.", "In particular, a large proportion of our common stock has been historically and may in the future be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock, further influencing volatility in its market price.", "Public perception of our company or management and other factors outside of our control may additionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention, regardless of actual operating performance.", "In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market or the market price of our shares, securities class action litigation has been filed against us.", "While we defend such actions vigorously, any judgment against us or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.", "We expect our period-to-period financial results to vary based on our operating costs, which we anticipate will fluctuate as the pace at which we continue to design, develop and manufacture new products and increase production capacity by expanding our current manufacturing facilities and adding future facilities, may not be consistent or linear between periods.", "Additionally, our revenues from period to period may fluctuate as we introduce existing products to new markets for the first time and as we develop and introduce new products.", "As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results, especially in the short term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance.", "Moreover, our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts, ratings agencies or investors, who may be focused only on short-term quarterly financial results.", "If any of this occurs, the trading price of our stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time.", "We may provide from time to time guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance.", "Correctly identifying key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process, and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate and has in the past been inaccurate in certain respects, such as the timing of new product manufacturing ramps.", "Our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those relating to anticipated production and sales volumes (which generally are not linear throughout a given period), average sales prices, supplier and commodity costs and planned cost reductions.", "If our guidance varies from actual results, such as due to our assumptions not being met or the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties, the market value of our common stock could decline significantly.", "Certain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, a portion of which was used to purchase shares of common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to third- party participants in such offerings and placements.", "We are not a party to these loans, which are partially secured by pledges of a portion of the Tesla common stock currently owned by Mr. Musk.", "If the price of our common stock were to decline substantially, Mr. Musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of Tesla common stock to satisfy his loan obligations if he could not do so through other means.", "Any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further.", "Further, Mr. Musk from time to time may commit to investing in significant business or other ventures, and as a result, be required to sell shares of our common stock in satisfaction of such commitments.", "Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws afford certain rights

Law and other provisions of Delaware law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain business combinations.", "In addition, the terms of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase such notes in the event of a fundamental change, including a takeover of our company.", "Any of the foregoing provisions and terms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.", "We are headquartered in Austin, Texas.", "Our principal facilities include a large number of properties in North America, Europe and Asia utilized for

fiscal year 2021, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 7, 2022.", "Our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.", "We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high- performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products.", "We also offer maintenance, installation, operation, financial and other services related to our products.", "Additionally, we are increasingly focused on products and services based on artificial intelligence, robotics and automation.", "In 2022, we produced 1,369,611 consumer vehicles and delivered 1,313,851 consumer vehicles, despite ongoing supply chain and logistics challenges and factory shutdowns.", "We are currently focused on increasing vehicle production, capacity and delivery capabilities, improving and developing battery technologies, improving our FSD capabilities, increasing the affordability and efficiency of our vehicles, bringing new products to market and expanding our global infrastructure.", "In 2022, we deployed 6.5 GWh of energy storage products and 348 megawatts of solar energy systems.", "We are currently focused on ramping production of energy storage products, improving our Solar Roof installation capability and efficiency, and increasing market share of retrofit and new build solar energy systems.", "In 2022, we recognized total revenues of $81.46 billion, respectively, representing an increase of $27.64 billion, compared to the prior year.", "We continue to ramp production, build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products and further revenue growth.", "In 2022, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $12.56 billion, representing a favorable change of $7.04 billion, compared to the prior year.", "We continue to focus on improving our profitability through production and operational efficiencies.", "We ended 2022 with $22.19 billion in cash and cash equivalents and investments, representing an increase of $4.48 billion from the end of 2021.", "Our cash flows provided by operating activities during 2022 and 2021 were $14.72 billion and $11.50 billion, respectively, representing an increase of $3.23 billion.", "Capital expenditures amounted to $7.16 billion during 2022, compared to $6.48 billion during 2021.", "Sustained growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself, and we will continue investing in a number of capital-intensive projects in upcoming periods.", "Management Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2023 Outlook", "The following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:", "We are focused on growing our manufacturing capacity, which includes ramping all of our production vehicles to their installed production capacities as well as increasing production rate, efficiency and capacity at our current factories.", "The next phase of production growth will depend on the ramp at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas, as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are developing to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range.", "Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease production costs and increase affordability.", "However, these plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by the new product and manufacturing technologies we are introducing, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control such as the COVID- 19 pandemic.", "Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory.", "Our cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles’ affordability, and for example, have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles in China.", "We will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles’ performance and functionality, including through products based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot and FSD, and other software features, and delivering new vehicles, such as the Tesla Semi in December 2022.", "Moreover, we expect to continue to benefit from ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and increasing environmental awareness.", "However, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to trade and the environment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, increases in interest rates and any future global impact from the COVID-19 pandemic.", "For example, in the earlier part of 2022, the automotive industry in general experienced part shortages and supplier disruptions which impacted production leading to a general increase in vehicle pricing.", "As the year progressed, inflationary pressures increased across the markets in which we operate.", "In an effort to curb this trend, central banks in developed countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, impacting the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements.", "Further, sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations.", "Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to adjust and continue to execute well to maintain our momentum.", "These macroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, and order rate for our vehicles, and we will continue to adjust accordingly to such developments.", "As our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not become a bottleneck on our total deliveries.", "Beginning the second half of 2022, due to continuing challenges caused by vehicle transportation capacity during peak delivery periods, we began transitioning to a more even regional mix of vehicle builds each week, which led to an increase in cars in transit at the end of the year.", "Increasing the exports of vehicles manufactured at Gigafactory Shanghai has also been effective in mitigating the strain on our deliveries in markets outside of the United States, and we expect to benefit further from situating additional factories closer to local markets, including the production launch at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Austin.", "As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will also have to continue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction.", "In particular, we remain focused on increasing the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations.", "Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment", "The long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes.", "We continue to increase the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand.", "For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones.", "For Powerwall, better availability and growing grid stability concerns drive higher customer interest.", "We remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a low-cost and simplified online ordering experience.", "In addition, we continue to seek to improve our installation capabilities and price efficiencies for Solar Roof.", "As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and hire additional personnel, particularly skilled electricians, to support the ramp of Solar Roof.", "Our capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short-term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions.", "We are simultaneously ramping new products, ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents and piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects.", "Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development, all other continuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to be between $6.00 to $8.00 billion in 2023 and between $7.00 to $9.00 billion in each of the following two fiscal years.", "Our business has recently been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also facilitating positive cash generation.", "We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers.", "On the other hand, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and rising material prices and increasing supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.", "As long as we see expanding sales, and excluding the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions including increased labor costs and impairment charges on certain assets as explained below, we generally expect operating expenses relative to revenues to decrease as we continue to increase operational efficiency and process automation.", "We expect operating expenses to continue to grow in 2023 as we are expanding our operations globally.", "In the first quarter of 2021, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin.", "As with any investment and consistent with how we manage fiat-based cash and cash-equivalent accounts, we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions.", "Digital assets are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules.", "Accordingly, any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges, whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale.", "For any digital assets held now or in the future, these charges may negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets increase.", "For example, in the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $204 million of impairment losses resulting from changes to the carrying value of our bitcoin and gains of $64 million on certain conversions of bitcoin into fiat currency by us.", "The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”).", "The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures.", "We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.", "Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period.", "Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management.", "We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.", "To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.", "The estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, the collectability of accounts and financing receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted.", "We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained.", "Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.", "Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), including access to our FSD features, internet connectivity, Supercharger network and over- the-air software updates.", "We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers.", "Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term.", "We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms.", "Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, legacy programs offering unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer.", "Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier.", "We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle.", "Revenue related to FSD is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and the portion related to software updates is recognized over time.", "For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.", "Any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue.", "Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles.", "As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred.", "Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue.", "Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.", "We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners.", "Under these programs, we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a pre-determined resale value.", "We account for such automotive sales as a sale with a right of return when we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception.", "The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise.", "On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles sold with resale value guarantees to determine whether there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns.", "As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values.", "Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.", "Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis.", "We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts.", "If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.", "We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory.", "This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product.", "Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.", "Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required.", "A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.", "We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years.", "We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified.", "These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims.", "These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future.", "The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred.", "The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long- term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.", "Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.", "Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment.", "We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards.", "The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.", "The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility.", "These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment.", "The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock.", "The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP.", "Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.", "For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.", "As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods.", "Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.", "We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions.",

subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals.", "The U.S., many countries in the European Union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard.", "As of December 31, 2022, we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized.", "Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted.", "Furthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions.", "In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain.", "As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes or taxes payable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome.", "These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that some of those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities.", "We are required to file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions.", "Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to our tax positions.", "We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law.", "We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate.", "To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations, such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.", "The eventual", "impact on our income tax expense depends in part if

Court ordered a new trial on damages only, to commence on March 27, 2023.", "Tesla continues to believe that the facts and law do not justify the damages awarded and is assessing its next steps.", "On February 9, 2022, shortly after the Diaz jury verdict, the California Civil Rights Department (”CRD,” formerly “DFEH”) filed a civil complaint against Tesla in Alameda County, California Superior Court, alleging systemic race discrimination, hostile work environment and pay equity claims, among others.", "CRD’s amended complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief.", "On September 22,

operation of these VIEs, including determining the solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts to be sold or contributed to these VIEs, redeploying solar energy systems and managing customer receivables.", "We consider that the rights granted to the fund investors under the agreements are more protective in nature rather than participating.", "As the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, we consolidate in the financial statements the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of these VIEs, and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.", "Cash distributions of income and other receipts by a fund, net of agreed upon expenses, estimated expenses, tax benefits and detriments of

the interim term, we resumed our annual evaluation of all available options for providing directors’ and officers’ indemnity coverage, which we had suspended during the height of shelter-in-place requirements related to the COVID-19 pandemic.", "As part of such process, we obtained a binding market quote for a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy with an aggregate coverage limit of $100 million.", "Pursuant to the indemnification agreement, our CEO provided, from his personal funds, directors’ and officers’ indemnity coverage to us during the interim term in the event such coverage is not indemnifiable by us, up to a total of $100 million.", "In return, we paid our CEO a total of $3 million, which represents the market-based premium for the market quote described above as prorated for 90 days and further discounted by 50%.", "Following the lapse of the 90-day period, we did not extend the term of the indemnification agreement with our CEO and instead bound a customary directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy with third-party carriers.", "In relation to our CEO’s exercise of stock options and sale of common stock from the 2012 CEO Performance

business, financial condition and operating results.", "Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business", "We have previously experienced and may in the future experience launch and production ramp delays for new products and features.", "For example, we encountered unanticipated supplier issues that led to delays during the initial ramp of our first Model X and experienced challenges with a supplier and with ramping full automation for certain of our initial Model 3 manufacturing processes.", "In addition, we may introduce in the future new or unique manufacturing processes and design features for our products.", "As we expand our vehicle offerings and global footprint, there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully and timely introduce and scale such processes or features.", "In particular, our future business depends in large part on increasing the production of mass-market vehicles.", "In order to be successful, we will need to implement, maintain and ramp efficient and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains and achieve the design tolerances, high quality and output rates we have planned at our manufacturing facilities in California, Nevada, Texas, China, Germany and any future sites such as Mexico.", "We will also need to hire, train and compensate skilled employees to operate these facilities.", "Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such as those we experienced in the past may arise during our production ramps, and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing processes and reducing costs.", "If we are not successful in achieving these goals, we could face delays in establishing and/or sustaining our product ramps or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets.", "We have experienced, and may also experience similar future delays in launching and/or ramping production of our energy storage products and Solar Roof; new product versions or variants; new vehicles; and future features and services based on artificial intelligence.", "Likewise, we may encounter delays with the design, construction and regulatory or other approvals necessary to build and bring online future manufacturing facilities and products.", "Any delay or other complication in ramping the production of our current products or the development, manufacture, launch and production ramp of our future products, features and services, or in doing so cost-effectively and with high quality, may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.", "Our products contain thousands of parts purchased globally from hundreds of suppliers, including single-source direct suppliers, which exposes us to multiple potential sources of component shortages.", "Unexpected changes in business conditions, materials pricing, including inflation of raw material costs, labor issues, wars, trade policies, natural disasters, health epidemics such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, trade and shipping disruptions, port congestions, cyberattacks and other factors beyond our or our suppliers’ control could also affect these suppliers’ ability to deliver components to us or to remain solvent and operational.", "For example, a global shortage of semiconductors beginning in early 2021 has caused challenges in the manufacturing industry and impacted our supply chain and production.", "Additionally, if our suppliers do not accurately forecast and effectively allocate production or if they are not willing to allocate sufficient production to us, or face other challenges such as insolvency, it may reduce our access to components and require us to search for new suppliers.", "The unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delays, idle manufacturing facilities, product design changes and loss of access to important technology and tools for producing and supporting our products, as well as impact our capacity expansion and our ability to fulfill our obligations under customer contracts.", "Moreover, significant increases in our production or product design changes by us have required and may in the future require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time.", "We have faced in the past, and may face suppliers who are unwilling or unable to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost, quality and volume needs, which may increase our costs or require us to replace them with other sources.", "Finally, as we construct new manufacturing facilities and add production lines to existing facilities, we may experience issues in correspondingly increasing the level of localized procurement at those facilities.", "While we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources or develop our own replacements for most of our components, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly or at all.", "Additionally, we may be unsuccessful in our continuous efforts to negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid unfavorable changes to terms, source less expensive suppliers for certain parts and redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce, especially in the case of increases in materials pricing.", "Any of these occurrences may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.", "As the scale of our vehicle production increases, we will also need to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport components at high volumes to our manufacturing facilities and servicing locations internationally.", "If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation, inventory management and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain and parts management, we may incur unexpected production disruption, storage, transportation and write-off costs, which may harm our business and operating results.", "Our ability to increase production of our vehicles on a sustained basis, make them affordable globally by accessing local supply chains and workforces and streamline delivery logistics is dependent on the construction and ramp of our current and future factories.", "The construction of and commencement and ramp of production at these factories are subject", "to a number of uncertainties inherent in all new manufacturing operations, including ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements, procurement and maintenance of construction, environmental and operational licenses and approvals for additional expansion, supply chain constraints, hiring, training and retention of qualified employees and the pace of bringing production equipment and processes online with the capability to manufacture high-quality units at scale.", "Moreover, we will have to establish and ramp production of our proprietary battery cells and packs at our new factories, and we additionally intend to incorporate sequential design and manufacturing changes into vehicles manufactured at each new factory.", "If we experience any issues or delays in meeting our projected timelines, costs, capital efficiency and production capacity for our new factories, expanding and managing teams to implement iterative design and production changes there, maintaining and complying with the terms of any debt financing that we obtain to fund them or generating and maintaining demand for the vehicles we manufacture there, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition may be harmed.", "Our success will depend on our ability to continue to expand our sales capabilities.", "We are targeting a global mass demographic with a broad range of potential customers, in which we have relatively limited experience projecting demand and pricing our products.", "We currently produce numerous international variants at a limited number of factories, and if our specific demand expectations for these variants prove inaccurate, we may not be able to timely generate deliveries matched to the vehicles that we produce in the same timeframe or that are commensurate with the size of our operations in a given region.", "Likewise, as we develop and grow our energy products and services worldwide, our success will depend on our ability to correctly forecast demand in various markets.", "Because we do not have independent dealer networks, we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicles to our customers.", "As our production volumes continue to grow, we have faced in the past, and may face challenges with deliveries at increasing volumes, particularly in international markets requiring significant transit times.", "We have also deployed a number of delivery models, such as deliveries to customers’ homes and workplaces and touchless deliveries, but there is no guarantee that such models will be scalable or be accepted globally.", "Likewise, as we ramp our energy products, we are working to substantially increase our production and installation capabilities.", "If we experience production delays or inaccurately forecast demand, our business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.", "Moreover, because of our unique expertise with our vehicles, we recommend that our vehicles be serviced by us or by certain authorized professionals.", "If we experience delays in adding servicing capacity or servicing our vehicles efficiently, or experience unforeseen issues with the reliability of our vehicles, particularly higher-volume additions to our fleet such as Model 3 and Model Y, it could overburden our servicing capabilities and parts inventory.", "Similarly, the increasing number of Tesla vehicles also requires us to continue to rapidly increase the number of our Supercharger stations and connectors throughout the world.", "There is no assurance that we will be able to ramp our business to meet our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and vehicle charging targets globally, that our projections on which such targets are based will prove accurate or that the pace of growth or coverage of our customer infrastructure network will meet customer expectations.", "These plans require significant cash investments and management resources and there is no guarantee that they will generate additional sales or installations of our products, or that we will be able to avoid cost overruns or be able to hire additional personnel to support them.", "As we expand, we will also need to ensure our compliance with regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions applicable to the sale, installation and servicing of our products, the sale or dispatch of electricity related to our energy products and the operation of Superchargers.", "If we fail to manage our growth effectively, it may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.", "We are dependent on the continued supply of lithium-ion battery cells for our vehicles and energy storage products, and we will require substantially more cells to grow our business according to our plans.", "Currently, we rely on suppliers such as Panasonic and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) for these cells.", "We have to date fully qualified only a very limited number of such suppliers and have limited flexibility in changing suppliers.", "Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from our suppliers could limit production of our vehicles and energy storage products.", "In the long term, we intend to supplement cells from our suppliers with cells manufactured by us, which we believe will be more efficient, manufacturable at greater volumes and more cost-effective than currently available cells.", "However, our efforts to develop and manufacture such battery cells have required, and may continue to require, significant investments, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these targets in the timeframes that we have planned or at all.", "If we are", "unable to do so, we may have to curtail our planned vehicle and energy storage product production or procure additional cells from suppliers at potentially greater costs, either of which may harm our business and operating results.", "In addition, the cost and mass production of battery cells, whether manufactured by our suppliers or by us, depends in part upon the prices and availability of raw materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and/or other metals.", "The prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials.", "For example, as a result of increased global production of electric vehicles and energy storage products, suppliers of these raw materials may be unable to meet our volume needs.", "Additionally, our suppliers may not be willing or able to reliably meet our timelines or our cost and quality needs, which may require us to replace them with other sources.", "Any reduced availability of these materials may impact our access to cells and our growth, and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup such costs through increased prices.", "Moreover, our inability to meet demand and any product price increases may harm our brand, growth, prospects and operating results.", "Though we continue to see increased interest and adoption of electric vehicles, if the market for electric vehicles in general and Tesla vehicles in particular does not develop as we expect, develops more slowly than we expect, or if demand for our vehicles decreases in our markets or our vehicles compete with each other, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.", "In addition, electric vehicles still constitute a small percentage of overall vehicle sales.", "As a result, the market for our vehicles could be negatively affected by numerous factors, such as:", "perceptions about electric vehicle features, quality, safety, performance and cost;", "perceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge, and access to charging facilities;", "competition, including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and high fuel-economy internal combustion engine vehicles;", "volatility in the cost of oil, gasoline and energy;", "government regulations and economic incentives and conditions; and", "The target demographics for our vehicles are highly competitive.", "Sales of vehicles in the automotive industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to further volatility.", "We also cannot predict the duration or direction of current global trends or their sustained impact on consumer demand.", "Ultimately, we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, and attempt to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources accordingly.", "Rising interest rates may lead to consumers to increasingly pull back spending, including on our products, which may harm our demand, business and operating results.", "If we experience unfavorable global market conditions, or if we cannot or do not maintain operations at a scope that is commensurate with such conditions or are later required to or choose to suspend such operations again, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.", "The worldwide automotive market is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future.", "A significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are reported to have plans to enter, the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, as well as the market for self-driving technology and other vehicle applications and software platforms.", "In some cases, our competitors offer or will offer electric vehicles in important markets such as China and Europe, and/or have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future.", "In addition, certain government and economic incentives which provide benefits to manufacturers who assemble domestically or have local suppliers, may provide a greater benefit to our competitors, which could negatively impact our profitability.", "Many of our competitors have significantly more or better-established resources than we do to devote to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products.", "Increased", "competition could result in our lower vehicle unit sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.", "We also face competition in our energy generation and storage business from other manufacturers, developers, installers and service providers of competing energy technologies, as well as from large utilities.", "Decreases in the retail or wholesale prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of customer defaults.", "Our plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicles and energy storage products depends on significant lithium-ion battery cell production, including by our partner Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada.", "We also produce several vehicle components at our Gigafactories, such as battery modules and packs and drive units, and manufacture energy storage products.", "If we are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operations, or if we are unable to do so cost-effectively or hire and retain highly- skilled personnel there, our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be limited, which may harm our business and operating results.", "Finally, the high volumes of lithium-ion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured by us and by our suppliers are stored and recycled at our various facilities.", "Any mishandling of these products may cause disruption to the operation of such facilities.", "While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations.", "Any such disruptions or issues may harm our brand and business.", "We are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, political uncertainty and social, environmental and economic conditions in numerous jurisdictions, including markets in which we generate significant sales, over which we have little control and which are inherently unpredictable.", "Our operations in such jurisdictions, particularly as a company based in the U.S., create risks relating to conforming our products to regulatory and safety requirements and charging and other electric infrastructures; organizing local operating entities; establishing, staffing and managing foreign business locations; attracting local customers; navigating foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements; enforceability of our contractual rights; trade restrictions, customs regulations, tariffs and price or exchange controls; and preferences in foreign nations for domestically manufactured products.", "For example, we monitor tax legislation changes on a global basis, including changes arising as a result of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit shifting.", "Such conditions may increase our costs, impact our ability to sell our products and require significant management attention, and may harm our business if we are unable to manage them effectively.", "If our products contain design or manufacturing defects, whether relating to our software or hardware, that cause them not to perform as designed or intended or that require repair, or certain features of our vehicles such as new Autopilot or FSD Capability features take longer than expected to become enabled, are legally restricted or become subject to onerous regulation, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and services may be harmed, and we may experience delivery delays, product recalls, allegations of product liability, breach of warranty and related consumer protection claims and significant warranty and other expenses.", "While we are continuously working to develop and improve our products’ capability and performance, there is no guarantee that any incremental changes in the specific software or equipment we deploy in our vehicles over time will not result in initial functional disparities from prior iterations or will perform as forecast in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all.", "Although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible, such efforts may not be timely, may hamper production or may not completely satisfy our customers.", "We have performed, and continue to perform, extensive internal testing on our products and features, though, like the rest of the industry, we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate certain aspects of their long- term quality, reliability, durability and performance characteristics, including exposure to or consequence of external attacks.", "While we attempt to identify and address or remedy defects we identify pre-production and sale, there may be latent defects that we may be unable to detect or control for in our products, and thereby address, prior to their sale to or installation for customers.", "The automobile industry generally experiences significant product liability claims, and as such we face the risk of such claims in the event our vehicles do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected.", "As is true for other automakers, our vehicles have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in accidents resulting in death or personal injury, and such accidents where Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot or FSD Capability features are engaged are the subject of significant public attention, especially in light of NHTSA’s Standing General Order requiring reports regarding crashes involving vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems.", "We have experienced, and we expect to continue to face, claims and regulatory scrutiny arising from or related to misuse or claimed failures or alleged misrepresentations of such new technologies that we are pioneering.", "In addition, the battery packs that we produce make use of lithium-ion cells.", "On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells.", "While we have designed our battery packs to passively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells, there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, in particular due to a high-speed crash.", "Likewise, as our solar energy systems and energy storage products generate and store electricity, they have the potential to fail or cause injury to people or property.", "Any product liability claim may subject us to lawsuits and substantial monetary damages, product recalls or redesign efforts, and even a meritless claim may require us to defend it, all of which may generate negative publicity and be expensive and time-consuming.", "In most jurisdictions, we generally self-insure against the risk of product liability claims for vehicle exposure, meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds and not by insurance.", "In order to maintain and grow our business, we must maintain credibility and confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts, investors, ratings agencies and other parties in our long-term financial viability and business prospects.", "Maintaining such confidence may be challenging due to our limited operating history relative to established competitors; customer unfamiliarity with our products; any delays we may experience in scaling manufacturing, delivery and service operations to meet demand; competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services; our quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations; and other factors including those over which we have no control.", "In particular, Tesla’s products, business, results of operations, and statements and actions of Tesla and its management are subject to significant amounts of commentary by a range of third parties.", "Such attention can include criticism, which may be exaggerated or unfounded, such as speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management team.", "Any such negative perceptions, whether caused by us or not, may harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed.", "We offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in North America, Europe and Asia primarily ourselves and through various financial institutions.", "We also currently offer vehicle financing arrangements directly through our local subsidiaries in certain markets.", "Depending on the country, such arrangements are available for specified models and may include operating leases directly with us under which we typically receive only a very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease, followed by a stream of payments over the term of the lease.", "We have also offered various arrangements for customers of our solar energy systems whereby they pay us a fixed payment to lease or finance the purchase of such systems or purchase electricity generated by them.", "If we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national, state and/or local financial regulations and consumer protection laws governing these transactions, we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties.", "The profitability of any directly-leased vehicles returned to us at the end of their leases depends on our ability to accurately project our vehicles’ residual values at the outset of the leases, and such values may fluctuate prior to the end of their terms depending on various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles, economic cycles and the pricing of new vehicles.", "We have made in the past and may make in the future certain adjustments to our prices from time to time in the ordinary course of business, which may impact the residual values of our vehicles and reduce the profitability of our vehicle leasing program.", "The funding and growth of this program also rely on our ability to secure adequate financing and/or business partners.", "If we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program through internal funds, partners or other financing sources, and compelling alternative financing programs are not available for our customers who may expect or need such options, we may be unable to grow our vehicle deliveries.", "Furthermore, if our vehicle leasing business grows substantially, our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the resulting greater levels of residual risk.", "Similarly, we have provided resale value guarantees to vehicle customers and partners for certain financing programs, under which such counterparties may sell their vehicles back to us at certain points in time at pre-determined amounts.", "However, actual resale values are subject to fluctuations over the term of the financing arrangements, such as from the vehicle pricing changes discussed above.", "If the actual resale values of any vehicles resold or returned to us pursuant to these programs are materially lower than the pre- determined amounts we have offered, our financial condition and operating results may be harmed.", "Finally, our vehicle and solar energy system financing programs and our energy storage sales programs also expose us to customer credit risk.", "In the event of a widespread economic downturn or other catastrophic event, our customers may be unable or unwilling to satisfy their payment obligations to us on a timely basis or at all.", "If a significant number of our customers default, we may incur substantial credit losses and/or impairment charges with respect to the underlying assets.", "We are party to an operating lease and a research and development agreement through the State University of New York (the “SUNY Foundation”).", "These agreements provide for the construction and use of our Gigafactory New York, which we have primarily used for the development and production of our Solar Roof and other solar products and components, energy storage components and Supercharger components, and for other lessor-approved functions.", "Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during a period that was initially 10 years beginning April 30, 2018.", "As of December 31, 2023, we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo.", "While we expect to have and grow significant operations at Gigafactory New York and the surrounding Buffalo area, any failure by us in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet all applicable future obligations may result in our obligation to pay a “program payment” of $41 million to the SUNY Foundation for such year, the termination of our lease at Gigafactory New York which may require us to pay additional penalties, and/or the need to adjust certain of our operations.", "Any of the foregoing events may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.", "The loss of the services of any of our key employees or any significant portion of our workforce could disrupt our operations or delay the development, introduction and ramp of our products and services.", "In particular, we are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer.", "None of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business.", "Our future success also depends upon our ability to attract, hire and retain a large number of engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and delivery, service, installation, technology and support personnel, especially to support our planned high-volume product sales, market and geographical expansion and technological innovations.", "If we are not successful in managing these risks, our business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.", "Employees may leave Tesla or choose other employers over Tesla due to various factors, such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive or technology experience, or any negative publicity related to us.", "In regions where we have or will have operations, particularly significant engineering and manufacturing centers, there is strong competition for individuals with skillsets needed for our business, including specialized knowledge of electric vehicles, engineering and electrical and building construction expertise.", "We also compete with both mature and prosperous companies that have far greater financial resources than we do and start-ups and emerging companies that promise short-term growth opportunities.", "Finally, our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origins, with an emphasis on equity-based awards and benefits in order to closely align their incentives with the long-term interests of our stockholders.", "We periodically seek and obtain approval from our stockholders for future increases to the number of awards available under our equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans.", "If we are unable to obtain the requisite stockholder approvals for such future increases, we may have to expend additional cash to compensate our employees and our ability to retain and hire qualified personnel may be harmed.", "We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer.", "Although Mr.", "Musk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla.", "Mr. Musk also currently serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer of Space Exploration Technologies Corp., a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles, Chairman and Chief Technical Officer of X Corp., a social media company, and is involved in other emerging technology ventures.", "We continue to expand our information technology systems as our operations grow, such as product data management, procurement, inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management, financial, tax and regulatory compliance systems.", "This includes the implementation of new internally developed systems and the deployment of such systems in the U.S. and abroad.", "While, we maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against intellectual property theft, data breaches, sabotage and other external or internal cyber-attacks or misappropriation, our systems and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to malware, ransomware, viruses, denial-of-service attacks, phishing attacks, social engineering, computer hacking, unauthorized access, exploitation of bugs, defects and vulnerabilities, breakdowns, damage, interruptions, system malfunctions, power outages, terrorism, acts of vandalism, security breaches, security incidents, inadvertent or intentional actions by employees or other third parties, and other cyber-attacks.", "To the extent any security incident results in unauthorized access or damage to or acquisition, use, corruption, loss, destruction, alteration or dissemination of our data, including intellectual property and personal information, or our products or vehicles, or for it to be believed or reported that any of these occurred, it could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with applicable data breach notification laws, subject us to time consuming, distracting and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations and contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information.", "This could result in increased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure and/or reputational harm.", "We also rely on service providers, and similar incidents relating to their information technology systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business.", "There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks.", "Our service providers, including our workforce management software provider, have been subject to ransomware and other security incidents, and we cannot guarantee that our or our service providers’ systems have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in a security incident, or other disruption to, our or our service providers’ systems.", "Our ability to monitor our service providers’ security measures is limited, and, in any event, malicious third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures.", "Further, the implementation, maintenance, segregation and improvement of these systems require significant management time, support and cost, and there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems and updating current systems, including disruptions to the related areas of business operation.", "These risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory, procure parts or supplies or manufacture, sell, deliver and service products, adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain compliance with, or realize available benefits under, tax laws and other applicable regulations.", "Moreover, if we do not successfully implement, maintain or expand these systems as planned, our operations may be disrupted, our ability to accurately and/or timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting, which may impact our ability to certify our financial results.", "Moreover, our proprietary information, including intellectual property and personal information, could be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected.", "If these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to, we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions.", "Our products contain complex information technology systems.", "For example, our vehicles and energy storage products are designed with built-in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update their functionality.", "While we have implemented security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks, our products and their systems, malicious entities have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such networks, products and systems to gain control of, or to change, our products’ functionality, user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our products.", "We encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our products through our security vulnerability reporting policy, and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability.", "However, there can be no assurance that any vulnerabilities will not be exploited before they can be identified, or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful.", "Any unauthorized access to or control of our products or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or government investigations.", "In addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our products, their systems or data, as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our products, their systems or data are capable of being hacked, may harm our brand, prospects and operating results.", "We have been the subject of such reports in the past.", "It is not uncommon for employees of certain trades at companies such as ours to belong to a union, which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages.", "Moreover, regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the U.S. mandate employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect to the relevant companies’ operations.", "Although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employees, they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union, or we may be required to become a union signatory.", "From time to time, labor unions have engaged in campaigns to organize certain of our operations, as part of which such unions have filed unfair labor practice charges against us with the National Labor Relations Board (the “NLRB”), and they may do so in the future.", "Any unfavorable ultimate outcome for Tesla may have a negative impact on the perception of Tesla’s treatment of our employees.", "Furthermore, we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as suppliers and trucking and freight companies.", "Any work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and may harm our business and operating results.", "As a manufacturing company, we must manage the risk of product recalls with respect to our products.", "Recalls for our vehicles have resulted from various hardware and software-related safety concerns or non-compliance determinations.", "In addition to recalls initiated by us for various causes, testing of or investigations into our products by government regulators or industry groups may compel us to initiate product recalls or may result in negative public perceptions about the safety of our products, even if we disagree with the defect determination or have data that contradicts it.", "In the future, we may voluntarily or involuntarily initiate recalls if any of our products are determined by us or a regulator to contain a safety defect or be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations, such as U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.", "Such recalls, whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers, could result in significant expense, supply chain complications and service burdens, and may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.", "We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell directly to customers.", "We also provide certain warranties with respect to the energy generation and storage systems we sell, including on their installation and maintenance.", "For components not manufactured by us, we generally pass through to our customers the applicable manufacturers’ warranties, but may retain some warranty responsibilities for some or all of the life of such components.", "As part of our energy generation and storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that guarantee that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or other energy performance requirements specified in the contract.", "Under these performance guarantees, we generally bear the risk of electricity production or other performance shortfalls, including in some cases shortfalls caused by failures in components from third party manufacturers.", "These risks are exacerbated in the event such manufacturers cease operations or fail to honor their warranties.", "If our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products, our financial condition and operating results may be harmed.", "Warranty reserves include our management’s best estimates of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty, which are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims.", "Such estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience, especially with respect to products that we have introduced relatively recently and/or that we expect to produce at significantly greater volumes than our past products, may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future.", "We may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and other claims against us, for which we may have no insurance coverage.", "As a general matter, we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do, and in some cases, we do not maintain any at all.", "Additionally, the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles or self-insured retentions, policy limitations and exclusions, and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us.", "A loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts, which may harm our financial condition and operating results.", "The terms of certain of our debt facilities contain, and any of our other future debt agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business, including restrictions on our and/or our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional debt or create liens.", "In addition, under certain circumstances we are required to maintain a certain amount of liquidity.", "As a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and engage in beneficial transactions, including to obtain additional financing as needed, may be restricted.", "Furthermore, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements, which could permit the holders to accelerate our obligation to repay the debt.", "If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it.", "Our business and our future plans for expansion are capital-intensive, and the specific timing of cash inflows and outflows may fluctuate substantially from period to period.", "We may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity- related or debt securities or through obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund, together with our principal sources of liquidity, the costs of developing and manufacturing our current or future products, to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments, or to refinance our significant consolidated indebtedness, even if not required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness.", "We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all.", "If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.", "We depreciate the cost of our manufacturing equipment over their expected useful lives.", "However, product cycles or manufacturing technology may change periodically, and we may decide to update our products or manufacturing processes more quickly than expected.", "Moreover, improvements in engineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency may result in our ability to manufacture our products using less of our currently installed equipment.", "Alternatively, as we ramp and mature the production of our products to higher levels, we may discontinue the use of already installed equipment in favor of different or additional equipment.", "The useful life of any equipment that would be retired early as a result would be shortened, causing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated, and our results of operations may be harmed.", "As of December 31, 2023, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $4.68 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness (see Note 11, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).", "Our consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions.", "We and our subsidiaries may, subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness, incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt.", "Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due, to make payments upon conversion or repurchase demands with respect to our convertible senior notes or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or desire, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control.", "Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur, and to make necessary capital expenditures.", "If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive.", "Our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time.", "In addition, our ability to make payments may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness.", "We may not be able to engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all, which may result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness and harm our financial condition and operating results.", "We transact business globally in multiple currencies and have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue, operating expenses and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.", "To the extent we have significant revenues denominated in such foreign currencies, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in U.S. dollars, as we have historically experienced, and are currently experiencing.", "In addition, a portion of our costs and expenses have been, and we anticipate will continue to be, denominated in foreign currencies.", "If we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the U.S. dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies, our costs as measured in U.S. dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer.", "As a result, our operating results may be harmed.", "Our competitors or other third parties may hold or obtain patents, copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary rights that could prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, develop, sell or market our products and services, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business.", "From time to time, the holders of such intellectual property rights may assert their rights and urge us to take licenses and/or may bring suits alleging infringement or misappropriation of such rights, which could result in substantial costs, negative publicity and management attention, regardless of merit.", "In addition, the effective protection for our brands, technologies, and proprietary information may be limited or unavailable in certain countries, making it difficult to protect our intellectual property from misappropriation or infringement.", "Although we make reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, we cannot guarantee that these actions will deter or prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property.", "The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and confidential information could affect our competitive position.", "While we endeavor to obtain and protect the intellectual property rights that we expect will allow us to retain or advance our strategic initiatives in these circumstances, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately identify and protect the portions of intellectual property that are strategic to our business, or mitigate the risk of potential suits or other legal demands by third parties.", "Accordingly, we may consider the entering into licensing agreements with respect to such rights, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur, and such licenses and associated litigation could significantly increase our operating expenses.", "Further, if we are determined to have or believe there is a high likelihood that we have infringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease making, selling or incorporating certain components or intellectual property into the goods and services we offer, to pay substantial damages and/or license royalties, to redesign our products and services and/or to establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services.", "In the event that we are required to take one or more such actions, our brand, business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.", "Companies across many industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices.", "Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the non-financial impacts of their investments.", "While our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy, if our ESG practices do not meet investor or other industry stakeholder expectations, which continue to evolve, we may incur additional costs and our brand, ability to attract and retain qualified employees and business may be harmed.", "We may be impacted by natural disasters, wars, health epidemics, weather conditions, the long-term effects of climate change, power outages or other events outside of our control.", "For example, our Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Nevada are located in seismically active regions in Northern California and Nevada, and our Gigafactory Shanghai is located in a flood-prone area.", "Moreover, the area in which our Gigafactory Texas is located experienced severe winter storms in the first quarter of 2021 that had a widespread impact on utilities and transportation.", "If major disasters such as earthquakes, floods or other climate-related events occur, or our information system or communication breaks down or operates improperly, our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged, or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products.", "In addition, the global COVID-19 pandemic has impacted economic markets, manufacturing operations, supply chains, employment and consumer behavior in nearly every geographic region and industry across the world, and we have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected as a result.", "Also, the broader consequences in the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which may include further embargoes, regional instability and geopolitical shifts; airspace bans relating to certain routes, or strategic decisions to alter certain routes; and potential retaliatory action by the Russian government against companies, and the extent of the conflict on our business and operating results cannot be predicted.", "We may incur expenses or delays relating to such events outside of our control, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.", "Government and economic incentives that support the development and adoption of electric vehicles in the U.S. and abroad, including certain tax exemptions, tax credits and rebates, may be reduced, eliminated, amended or exhausted from time to time.", "For example, previously available incentives favoring electric vehicles in certain areas have expired or were cancelled or temporarily unavailable, and in some cases were not eventually replaced or reinstituted, which may have negatively impacted sales.", "In addition, certain government and economic incentives may also be implemented or amended to provide benefits to manufacturers who assemble domestically, have local suppliers or have other characteristics that may not apply to Tesla.", "Such developments could negatively impact demand for our vehicles, and we and our customers may have to adjust to them, including through pricing modifications.", "In addition, certain governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy storage product businesses allow us to lower our costs and encourage customers to buy our products and investors to invest in our solar financing funds.", "However, these incentives may expire when the allocated funding is exhausted, reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase, sometimes without warning.", "Likewise, in jurisdictions where net metering is currently available, our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy that their solar energy systems generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use.", "The benefit available under net metering has been or has been proposed to be reduced, altered or eliminated in several jurisdictions, and has also been contested and may continue to be contested before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.", "Any reductions or terminations of such incentives may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results by making our products less competitive for customers, increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract investment partners and to form new financing funds for our solar and energy storage assets.", "Finally, we and our fund investors claim these U.S. federal tax credits and certain state incentives in amounts based on independently appraised fair market values of our solar and energy storage systems.", "Some governmental authorities have audited such values and in certain cases have determined that these values should be lower, and they may do so again in the future.", "Such determinations may result in adverse tax consequences and/or our obligation to make indemnification or other payments to our funds or fund investors.", "As we grow our manufacturing operations in additional regions, we are or will be subject to complex environmental, manufacturing, health and safety laws and regulations at numerous jurisdictional levels in the U.S., China, Germany and other locations abroad, including laws relating to the use, handling, storage, recycling, disposal and/or human exposure to hazardous materials, product material inputs and post-consumer products and with respect to constructing, expanding and maintaining our facilities.", "New, or changes in, environmental and climate change laws, regulations or rules could also lead to increased costs of compliance, including", "remediations of any discovered issues, and changes to our operations, which may be significant, and any failures to comply could result in significant expenses, delays or fines.", "In addition, as we have", "increased our employee headcount and operations, we are and may continue to be subject to increased scrutiny, including litigation and government investigations, that we will need to defend against.", "If we are unable to successfully defend ourselves in such litigation or government investigations, it may harm our brand, ability to attract and retain qualified employees, business and financial condition.", "We are also subject to laws and regulations applicable to the supply, manufacture, import, sale, service and performance of our products both domestically and abroad.", "For example, in countries outside of the U.S., we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety, fuel economy and emissions that are often materially different from equivalent requirements in the U.S., thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in all countries.", "This process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry, as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems requirements.", "In particular, we offer in our vehicles in certain markets Autopilot and FSD Capability features that today assist drivers with certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel, but which currently require drivers to remain fully engaged in the driving operation.", "We are continuing to develop our Autopilot and FSD Capability technology.", "There are a variety of international, federal and state regulations that may apply to, and may adversely affect, the design and performance, sale, marketing, registration and operation of Autopilot and FSD Capability, and future capability, including full self-driving vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver.", "This includes many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to apply to vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver.", "Such regulations continue to rapidly change, which increases the likelihood of a patchwork of complex or conflicting regulations, or may delay, restrict or prohibit the availability of certain functionalities and vehicle designs, which could adversely affect our business.", "Finally, as a manufacturer, installer and service provider with respect to solar generation and energy storage systems, a supplier of electricity generated and stored by certain of the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers, and a provider of grid services through virtual power plant models, we are impacted by federal, state and local regulations and policies concerning the import or export of components, electricity pricing, the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electrical grid and the sale of electricity generated by third party-owned systems.", "If regulations and policies are introduced that adversely impact the import or export of components, or the interconnection, maintenance or use of our solar and energy storage systems, they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage products and services, threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and services in the relevant jurisdictions, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.", "Any failure by us or our vendors or other business partners to comply with our public privacy notice or with federal, state or international privacy, data protection or security laws or regulations relating to the processing, collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions against us, legal liability, fines, damages, ongoing audit requirements and other significant costs.", "Substantial expenses and operational changes may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws, and even an unsuccessful challenge by customers or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us.", "In addition, certain privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their interpretation, application and impact, and may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation.", "For example, the General Data Protection Regulation applies to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the European Union requiring certain data protection measures when handling, with a significant risk of fines for noncompliance.", "Similarly, our North American operations are subject to complex and changing federal and US state-specific data privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act which imposes certain legal obligations on our use and processing of personal information related to California residents.", "Finally, additional privacy and cybersecurity laws have come into effect in China.", "These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.", "Complying with emerging and changing requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs and make enhancements to relevant data practices.", "Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.", "In addition to the risks related to general privacy regulation, we may also be subject to specific vehicle manufacturer obligations relating to cybersecurity, data privacy and data localization requirements which place additional risks to our international operations.", "Risks and penalties could include ongoing audit requirements, data protection", "authority investigations, legal proceedings by international governmental entities or others resulting in mandated disclosure of sensitive data or other commercially unfavorable terms.", "Notwithstanding our efforts to protect the security and integrity of our customers’ personal information, we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if, for example, third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to the personal information we process and handle.", "A major breach of our network security and systems may occur despite defensive measures, and may result in fines, penalties and damages and harm our brand, prospects and operating results.", "We are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To our knowledge, no government agency in any such ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred.", "However, we cannot predict the outcome or impact of any such ongoing matters, and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future.", "Moreover, we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas, and if instituted, in defending against any governmental proceedings.", "While we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies, including sales through our website, we may not be able to sell our vehicles through our own stores in certain states in the U.S. with laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this direct-to-consumer sales model.", "It has also been asserted that the laws in some states limit our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators, and such assertions persist.", "In certain locations, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles have been, and may be, challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws.", "We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state franchise laws were not intended to apply to a manufacturer that does not have franchise dealers anywhere in the world.", "In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that, if enacted, would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model.", "A few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate, but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate.", "The application of state laws applicable to our operations continues to be difficult to predict.", "Internationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices.", "Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time.", "Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers may harm our financial condition and operating results.", "Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock", "The trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control.", "Our common stock has experienced over the last 52 weeks an intra-day trading high of $299.29 per share and a low of $152.37 per share.", "The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.", "In particular, a large proportion of our common stock has been historically and may in the future be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock, further influencing volatility in its market price.", "Public perception of our company or management and other factors outside of our control may additionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention, regardless of actual operating performance.", "In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market or the market price of our shares, securities class action litigation has been filed against us.", "While we defend such actions vigorously, any judgment against us or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.", "We expect our period-to-period financial results to vary based on our operating costs, which we anticipate will fluctuate as the pace at which we continue to design, develop and manufacture new products and increase production capacity by expanding our current manufacturing facilities and adding future facilities, may not be consistent or linear between periods.", "Additionally, our revenues from period to period may fluctuate as we introduce existing products to new markets for the first time and as we develop and introduce new products.", "As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results, especially in the short term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance.", "Moreover, our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts, ratings agencies or investors, who may be focused only on short-term quarterly financial results.", "If any of this occurs, the trading price of our stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time.", "We provide from time to time guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance.", "Correctly identifying key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process, and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate and has in the past been inaccurate in certain respects, such as the timing of new product manufacturing ramps.", "Our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those relating to anticipated production and sales volumes (which generally are not linear throughout a given period), average sales prices, supplier and commodity costs and planned cost reductions.", "If our guidance varies from actual results, such as due to our assumptions not being met or the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties, the market value of our common stock could decline significantly.", "Certain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, a portion of which was used to purchase shares of common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to third- party participants in such offerings and placements.", "We are not a party to these loans, which are partially secured by pledges of a portion of the Tesla common stock currently owned by Mr. Musk.", "If the price of our common stock were to decline substantially, Mr. Musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of Tesla common stock to satisfy his loan obligations if he could not do so through other means.", "Any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further.", "Further, Mr. Musk from time to time may commit to investing in significant business or other ventures, and as a result, be required to sell shares of our common stock in satisfaction of such commitments.", "Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws afford certain rights and powers to our board of directors that may facilitate the delay or prevention of an acquisition that it deems undesirable.", "We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and other provisions of Delaware law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain business combinations.", "In addition, the terms of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase such notes in the event of a fundamental change, including a takeover of our company.", "Any of the foregoing provisions and terms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.", "We recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats, as such term is defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K.", "These risks include, among other things: operational risks, intellectual property theft, fraud, extortion, harm to employees or customers and violation of data privacy or security laws.", "Identifying and assessing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes.", "Cybersecurity risks related to our business, technical operations, privacy and compliance issues are identified and addressed through a multi-faceted approach including third party assessments, internal IT Audit, IT security, governance, risk and compliance reviews.", "To defend, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents, we, among other things: conduct proactive privacy and cybersecurity reviews of systems and applications, audit applicable data policies, perform penetration testing using external third-party tools and techniques to test security controls, operate a bug bounty program to encourage proactive vulnerability reporting, conduct employee training, monitor emerging laws and regulations related to data protection and information security (including our consumer products) and implement appropriate changes.", "We have implemented incident response and breach management processes which have four overarching and interconnected stages: 1) preparation for a cybersecurity incident, 2) detection and analysis of a security incident, 3) containment, eradication and recovery, and 4) post-incident analysis.", "Such incident responses are overseen by leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity.", "Security events and data incidents are evaluated, ranked by severity and prioritized for response and remediation.", "Incidents are evaluated to determine materiality as well as operational and business impact, and reviewed for privacy impact.", "We also conduct tabletop exercises to simulate responses to cybersecurity incidents.", "Our team of cybersecurity professionals then collaborate with technical and business stakeholders across our business units to further analyze the risk to the company, and form detection, mitigation and remediation strategies.", "As part of the above processes, we regularly engage external auditors and consultants to assess our internal cybersecurity programs and compliance with applicable practices and standards.", "As of 2023, our Information Security Management System has been certified to conform to the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2013.", "Our risk management program also assesses third party risks, and we perform third-party risk management to identify and mitigate risks from third parties such as vendors, suppliers, and other business partners associated with our use of third-party service providers.", "Cybersecurity risks are evaluated when determining the selection and oversight of applicable third-party service providers and potential fourth-party risks when handling and/or processing our employee, business or customer data.", "In addition to new vendor onboarding, we perform risk management during third-party cybersecurity compromise incidents to identify and mitigate risks to us from third-party incidents.", "We describe whether and how risks from identified cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial

costs, improving and developing our vehicles and battery technologies, vertically integrating and localizing our supply chain, improving and further deploying our FSD capabilities, increasing the affordability and efficiency of our vehicles, bringing new products to market and expanding our global infrastructure, including our service and charging infrastructure.", "In 2023, we deployed 14.72 GWh of energy storage products and 223 megawatts of solar energy systems.", "We are currently focused on ramping production of energy storage products, improving our Solar Roof installation capability and efficiency, and increasing market share of retrofit solar energy systems.", "In 2023, we recognized total revenues of $96.77 billion, representing an increase of $15.31 billion, compared to the prior year.", "We continue to ramp production, build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products, and invest in research and development to accelerate our AI, software and fleet-based profits for further revenue growth.", "In 2023, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $15.00 billion, representing a favorable change of $2.44 billion, compared to the prior year.", "This included a one-time non-cash tax benefit of $5.93 billion for the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets.", "We continue to focus on further cost reductions and operational efficiencies while maximizing delivery volumes.", "We ended 2023 with $29.09 billion in cash and cash equivalents and investments, representing an increase of $6.91 billion from the end of 2022.", "Our cash flows provided by operating activities in 2023 and 2022 were $13.26 billion and $14.72 billion, respectively, representing a decrease of $1.47 billion.", "Capital expenditures amounted to $8.90 billion in 2023, compared to $7.16 billion in 2022, representing an increase of $1.74 billion.", "Sustained growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself, and we will continue investing in a number of capital-intensive projects and research and development in upcoming periods.", "Management Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2024 Outlook", "The following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:", "We are focused on growing our manufacturing capacity, which includes capacity for manufacturing new vehicle models such as our Cybertruck and next generation platform, and ramping all of our production vehicles to their installed production capacities as well as increasing production rate and efficiency at our current factories.", "The next phase of production growth will depend on the continued ramp at our factories and the introduction of our next generation platform, as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are developing to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range.", "Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease production costs and increase affordability and customer awareness.", "These plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by new product and manufacturing technologies we introduce, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control.", "For example, during the third quarter of 2023, we experienced a sequential decline in production volumes due to pre-planned shutdowns for upgrades at various factories.", "Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory.", "Our cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles’ affordability and have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles.", "We will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles’ performance and functionality, including through products based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot, FSD Capability, and other software features and delivering new vehicles, such as our Cybertruck.", "Moreover, we expect to continue to benefit from ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and increasing environmental regulations and initiatives.", "However, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to trade and the environment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, interest rate fluctuations and the liquidity of enterprise customers.", "For example, inflationary pressures have increased across the markets in which we operate.", "In an effort to curb this trend, central banks in developed countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, impacting the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements.", "Further, sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations.", "Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to adjust and continue to execute well to maintain our momentum.", "Additionally, our suppliers’ liquidity and allocation plans may be affected by current challenges in the North American automotive industry, which could reduce our access to components or result in unfavorable changes to cost.", "These macroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, and order rate for our vehicles, and in turn our operating margin.", "Changes in government and economic incentives in relation to electric vehicles may also impact our sales.", "We will continue to adjust accordingly to such developments, and we believe our ongoing cost reduction, including improved production innovation and efficiency at our newest factories and lower logistics costs, and focus on operating leverage will continue to benefit us in relation to our competitors, while our new products will help enable future growth.", "As our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not become a bottleneck on our total deliveries.", "We are also committed to reducing the percentage of vehicles delivered in the third month of each quarter, which will help to reduce the cost per vehicle.", "As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will also have to continue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction.", "In particular, as other automotive manufacturers have announced their adoption of the North American Charging Standard (“NACS”) and agreements with us to utilize our Superchargers, we must correspondingly expand our network in order to ensure adequate availability to meet customer demands.", "We also remain focused on continued enhancements of the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations.", "Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment", "The long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes.", "We continue to increase the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including the construction of a new Megafactory in Shanghai and the ongoing ramp at our Megafactory in Lathrop, California.", "For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones.", "We remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a low-cost and simplified online ordering experience.", "In addition, we continue to seek to improve our installation capabilities and price efficiencies for Solar Roof.", "As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and ensure the availability of qualified personnel, particularly skilled electricians, to support the ramp of Solar Roof.", "Our capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short-term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions.", "We are simultaneously ramping new products, building or ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents, piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, expanding our Supercharger network and investing in autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled training and products, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects.", "Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development, all other continuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to exceed $10.00 billion in 2024 and be between $8.00 to $10.00 billion in each of the following two fiscal years.", "Our business has been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also generally facilitating positive cash generation.", "We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers.", "At the same time, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and other potential variables such as rising material prices and increases in supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability.", "Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.", "The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”).", "The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures.", "We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.", "Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period.", "Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management.", "We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.", "To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.", "The estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, the collectability of accounts and financing receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted.", "We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or

or similar buyback terms.", "Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer.", "Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier.", "We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle.", "Revenue related to FSD Capability features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time.", "For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.", "Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.", "Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis.", "We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts.", "If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.", "We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory.", "This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product.", "Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.", "Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required.", "A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.", "We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years.", "We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified.", "These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims.", "These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future.", "The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred.", "The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.", "For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually obligated amounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion.", "Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.", "Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment.", "We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards.", "The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.", "The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility.", "These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment.", "The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock.", "The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP.", "Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.", "For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.", "As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods.", "Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.", "We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions.", "Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized.", "We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period.", "In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary differences.", "We also rely on our assessment of the Company’s projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income.", "Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information.", "Furthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions.", "In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain.", "As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes or taxes payable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome.", "These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that some of those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities.", "We are required to file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions.", "Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to our tax positions.", "We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law.", "We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate.", "To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations, such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which

material.", "The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have had a substantial impact on business and consumer activity, including contributing to a curtailment of certain business activities (including a decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods and services), significant ongoing supply chain disruptions, economic uncertainty and volatility in global financial markets.", "These consequences have significantly impacted, and may continue to significantly impact us, and have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on the operations, financial performance and liquidity of many of our customers.", "Because of ongoing uncertainty with respect to the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, the future impact on our operations, financial condition and liquidity also remains uncertain and difficult to predict.", "This impact will continue to depend on evolving factors, many of which are not within our control, and to which we may not be able to effectively respond.", "These risks include, but are not limited to: a significant reduction in revenue due to renewed or extended curtailment of business activities; a significant increase in our expenses or a reduction in our operating margins due to long-term changes in the mix of our products and services; effects from governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic (including workforce pressures); reductions in operating effectiveness due to employees working remotely or in hybrid models; unavailability of personnel; the delay or cancellation of capital projects and related delays in, or loss of, expected benefits therefrom; limited access to liquidity; increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets; further disruption of global supply chains; impairments in the fair value of our assets; increases in pension funding obligations; and reductions in our customers’ credit- worthiness.", "We conduct operations in over 220 countries and territories.", "Our operations are subject to cyclicality affecting national and international economies in general, as well as the local economic environments in which we operate.", "Changes in general economic conditions are beyond our control, and it may be difficult for us to adjust our business model to mitigate the impact of these factors.", "For example, we are affected by levels of industrial production, inflation, unemployment levels, consumer spending and retail activity.", "We could be materially affected by adverse developments in these aspects of the economy.", "We have also been, and may in the future be, adversely impacted by changes in general economic conditions as a result of geopolitical uncertainty and/or conflicts in or arising from the countries and/or regions where we operate, including the United Kingdom, the European Union, the Ukraine, the Russian Federation and the Trans-Pacific region.", "Changes in general economic conditions, or our inability to accurately forecast these changes or mitigate the impact of these conditions on our business, could materially adversely affect us.", "Our industry is rapidly evolving, including demands for faster deliveries and increased visibility into shipments.", "We expect to continue to face significant competition on a local, regional, national and international basis.", "Competitors include the U.S. and other international postal services, various motor carriers, express companies, freight forwarders, air couriers, large transportation and e- commerce companies that have made and continue to make significant investments in their own logistics capabilities, some of whom are currently our customers.", "We also face competition from start-ups and other smaller companies that combine technologies with flexible labor solutions such as crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs.", "Competition may also come from other sources in the future as new technologies are developed.", "Competitors have cost, operational and organizational structures that differ from ours and may offer services or pricing terms that we are not willing or able to offer.", "Additionally, to sustain the level of service and value that we deliver to our customers, from time to time we have raised, and may in the future raise, prices and our customers may not be willing to accept these higher prices.", "If we do not timely and appropriately respond to competitive pressures, including replacing any lost volume or maintaining our profitability, we could be materially adversely affected.", "Continued transportation market growth may further increase competition.", "As a result, competitors may improve their financial capacity and strengthen their competitive positions.", "Business combinations could also result in competitors providing a wider variety of services and products at competitive prices, which could materially adversely affect us.", "For the year ended December 31, 2022, business from one customer, Amazon.com, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for 11.3% of our consolidated revenues.", "Some of our other significant customers can account for a relatively significant portion of our revenues in a particular quarter or year.", "Customer impact on our revenue and profitability is based on factors such as: contractual volume amounts; pricing terms; product launches; e-commerce or other industry trends, including those related to the holiday season; business combinations and the overall growth of a customer's underlying business; as well as any disruptions to their businesses.", "Customers could choose, and have in the past chosen, to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors, demand pricing concessions for our services, require us to provide enhanced services that increase our costs, or develop their own logistics capabilities.", "In addition, certain of our significant customer contracts include termination rights of either party upon the occurrence of certain events or without cause upon advance notice to the other party.", "If all or a portion of our business relationships with one or more significant customers were to terminate or significantly change, this could materially adversely affect us.", "We maintain a large workforce.", "We necessarily depend on the skills and continued service of our employees.", "We also regularly seek to hire a large number of part-time and seasonal workers.", "We must be able to attract, engage, develop and retain a large and diverse global workforce and maintain an environment that supports our core values.", "If we are unable to hire, properly train or retain qualified employees, we could experience higher labor costs, reduced revenues, further increased workers' compensation and automobile liability claims, regulatory noncompliance, customer losses and diminution of our brand value or company culture, which could materially adversely affect us.", "Our ability to control labor costs has in the past been, and is expected to continue to be, subject to numerous factors, including turnover, training costs, regulatory changes, market pressures, inflation, unemployment levels and healthcare and other benefit costs.", "In addition, our strategic initiatives, including transformation, have led and are expected to continue to lead to the creation of fewer, but more impactful, jobs as we strive to lower our cost to serve.", "Our inability to continue to retain experienced and motivated employees may also materially adversely affect us.", "Many of our U.S. employees are employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (the \"Teamsters\").", "These agreements run through July 31, 2023.", "Our airline pilots, airline mechanics, ground mechanics and certain other employees are employed under other collective bargaining agreements.", "In addition, some of our international employees are employed under collective bargaining or similar agreements.", "Actual or threatened strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers' needs.", "We have begun negotiating the various supplemental agreements with the Teamsters and expect that negotiations with respect to the national master agreement will commence in April 2023.", "We are negotiating in good faith in an effort to reach an agreement that is in the best interests of our employees, the Teamsters and UPS; however, no assurances of our ability to do so, or the timing or terms thereof, can be provided.", "Customers may reduce their business or stop doing business with us if they believe that such actions or threatened actions may adversely affect our ability to provide services.", "We may permanently lose customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service, and this could materially adversely affect us.", "The terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations.", "Furthermore, our actions or responses to any such negotiations, labor disputes, strikes or work stoppages could negatively impact how our brand is perceived and our corporate reputation and have adverse effects on our business, including our results of operations.", "As a result of concerns about global terrorism and homeland security, various governments have adopted and may continue to adopt stricter security requirements, resulting in increased operating costs.", "Regulatory and legislative requirements may change periodically in response to evolving threats.", "We cannot determine the effect that any new requirements will have on our operations, cost structure or operating results, and new rules or other future security requirements may increase our operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies.", "Regardless of our compliance with security requirements or the steps we take to secure our facilities or fleet, we could also be the target of an attack or security breaches could occur, which could materially adversely affect us.", "We rely on information technology (\"IT\") networks and systems, including the internet and a number of internally-developed systems and applications, as well as certain technology systems from third-party vendors, to operate our business.", "For example, we rely on IT to receive package level information in advance of the physical receipt of packages, to move and track packages through our operations, to efficiently plan deliveries, to execute billing processes, and to track and report financial and operational data.", "Our franchise locations and subsidiaries also rely on IT systems to manage their business processes and activities.", "In addition, our services, and the operation of our networks and systems involve the collection, storage and transmission of significant amounts of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of customers, employees and others.", "We regularly move data across national borders, and are subject to a variety of evolving laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security.", "The scope of these laws is often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws.", "For example, the E.U.", "'s General Data Protection Regulation greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of, and potential penalties under, E.U.", "law, and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches.", "In addition, China and other countries have also enacted or proposed stringent data localization laws which could significantly increase our costs, require us to make extensive system or operational changes, or adversely affect the value of our services.", "IT systems (ours, as well as those of our franchisees, acquired businesses, and third-party service providers) are susceptible to damage, disruptions and shutdowns due to programming errors, defects or other vulnerabilities, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, ransomware or malware attacks, attacks by foreign governments and state-sponsored actors, theft, misconduct by employees or other insiders, telecommunications failures, misuse, human errors or other catastrophic events.", "These events, which have become more frequent and sophisticated, could, from time to time, cause material service outages, allow inappropriate or block legitimate access to systems or information, or result in other material interruptions in our business.", "In addition, the occurrence of any of these events could expose us, our customers, franchisees, service providers or others, to a risk of loss, disclosure or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personally identifiable information.", "The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently.", "In recent periods, the frequency and sophistication of cyber-attacks has increased, including as a result of state-sponsored cybersecurity attacks during periods of geopolitical conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.", "Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate measures to recognize, detect or prevent the occurrence of any of the events described above.", "We also may not discover the occurrence of any of the events described above for a significant period of time after the event occurs.", "Hybrid and remote working arrangements may heighten these risks.", "We also depend on and interact with the IT networks and systems of third-parties for many aspects of our operations, including our customers, franchisees and service providers such as cloud service providers and third-party delivery services.", "These third parties may have access to information we maintain about our company, operations, customers, employees and vendors, or operating systems that are critical to or can significantly impact our business operations.", "These third parties are subject to risks resulting from data breaches, cyberattacks, IT systems disruptions, and other events or actions described above that could damage, disrupt or close down their networks or systems.", "Security processes, protocols and standards that we implement and contractual provisions requiring security measures that we impose on such third-parties may not be sufficient or effective at preventing such events.", "Any of these events could result in unauthorized access to, or disruptions or denials of access to, misuse or disclosure of, information or systems that are important to us, including proprietary information, sensitive or confidential data, and other information about our operations, customers, employees and suppliers, including personal information.", "We have invested and expect to continue to invest in IT security initiatives, IT risk management and disaster recovery plans.", "The costs and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly frequent, complex and sophisticated cyber threats and regulatory requirements.", "The occurrence of any of the events described above could result in material disruptions in our business, the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to our brand and reputation, additional regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other potential material liability.", "In addition, our customers’ confidence in our ability to protect data and systems and to provide services consistent with their expectations could be impacted, further disrupting our operations.", "Similarly, an actual or alleged failure to comply with increasingly challenging", "U.S. and foreign data protection regulations or other data protection standards may expose us to litigation, fines, sanctions or other penalties.", "While we maintain cyber insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.", "Although to date we are unaware of any material data breach or system disruption, including a cyber-attack, we cannot provide any assurances that such events and impacts will not occur and be material in the future.", "Our efforts to deter, identify, mitigate and/or eliminate future breaches may require significant additional effort and expense and may not be successful.", "Our success depends in part on our ability to maintain the image of the UPS brand and our reputation.", "Service quality issues, actual or perceived, could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customers not to use UPS services.", "Also, adverse publicity or public sentiment surrounding labor relations, environmental, sustainability and governance (\"ESG\") concerns, physical or cyber security matters, political activities and similar matters, or attempts to connect our company to such issues, either in the U.S. or elsewhere, could materially adversely affect us.", "For example, damage to our reputation or loss of brand equity could require the allocation of resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.", "The effects of climate change present financial and operational risks to our business, both directly and indirectly.", "We have made several public statements regarding our intended reduction of carbon emissions, including our goal to achieve carbon neutrality in our global operations by 2050 and our other short- and mid-term environmental sustainability goals.", "Our ability to meet our goals will depend in part on significant technological advancements with respect to the development and availability of reliable, affordable and sustainable alternative solutions that are outside of our control, including aviation fuel and alternative fuel vehicles.", "While we remain committed to being responsive to the effects of climate change and reducing our carbon footprint, there can be no assurances that our goals and strategic plans to achieve those goals will be successful, that the costs related to climate transition will not be higher than expected, that the necessary technological advancements will occur in the timeframe we expect, or at all, that the severity of and or the pace of negative climate-related effects will not accelerate faster than expected, or that proposed regulation or deregulation related to climate change will not have a negative competitive impact, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures or other expenses, revenue or results of operations.", "Furthermore, methodologies for reporting climate-related information may be updated and previously reported information may be adjusted to reflect improvement in the availability and quality of third-party data, changing assumptions, changes in the nature and scope of our operations and other changes in circumstances.", "Our processes and controls for reporting climate-related information across our operations are evolving along with multiple disparate standards for identifying, measuring and reporting sustainability metrics, including disclosures that may be required by the SEC, European and other regulators, and such standards may change over time, which could result in significant revisions to our current goals, reported progress in achieving such goals, or our ability to achieve such goals in the future.", "Changes in regulation or technology impacting our business could require us to write down the carrying value of assets, which could result in material impairment charges.", "Moreover, we may determine that it is in our best interests to prioritize other business, social, governance or sustainable investments over the achievement of our current goals based on economic, regulatory or social factors, business strategy or other factors.", "If we do not meet these goals or there is perception that we failed to meet these goals, then, in addition to regulatory and legal risks related to compliance, we could incur adverse publicity and reaction, which could adversely impact our reputation, and in turn adversely impact our results of operations.", "Weather conditions or other natural or man-made disasters and the increased severity or frequency thereof (including as a result of climate change), including storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, rising temperatures, epidemics, pandemics, conflicts, civil or political unrest, or terrorist attacks, have in the past and may in the future disrupt our business.", "Customers may reduce shipments, supply chains may be disrupted, demand may be negatively impacted or our costs to operate our business may increase, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.", "Any such event affecting one of our major facilities could result in a significant interruption in or disruption of our business.", "A potential result of climate change is more frequent or more severe weather events or natural disasters.", "To the extent such weather events or natural disasters do become more frequent or severe, disruptions to our business and costs to repair damaged facilities or maintain or resume operations could increase.", "We have significant international operations.", "We are exposed to changing economic, political and social developments that are beyond our control.", "Emerging markets are often more volatile than those in other countries, and any broad-based downturn in these markets from any of those developments could reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "We are subject to many laws governing our international operations, including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and commercial customers, govern our environmental impact or labor matters, and restrict where we can do business, our shipments to certain countries and the information that we can provide to non-U.S. governments.", "Our failure to manage and anticipate these and other risks associated with our international operations could materially adversely affect us.", "From time to time we acquire businesses, form joint ventures and strategic alliances, and dispose of operations.", "Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends, in part, upon successful integration between the businesses involved, the performance of the underlying operations, capabilities or technologies and the management of the acquired operations.", "Accordingly, our financial results could be materially adversely affected by our failure to effectively integrate acquired operations, unanticipated performance or other issues or transaction-related charges.", "Fuel and energy costs have a significant impact on our operations.", "We require significant quantities of fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risks associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.", "We seek to mitigate our exposure to changing fuel prices through our pricing strategy and may utilize hedging transactions from time to time.", "If we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges, higher fuel costs could materially adversely impact our operating results.", "Even if we are able to offset changes in fuel costs with surcharges, high fuel surcharges have in the past, and may in the future result in a shift from our higher-yielding products to lower-yielding products or an overall reduction in volume, revenue and profitability.", "There can also be no assurance that our strategy will be effective.", "Moreover, we could experience a disruption in energy supplies as a result of new or increased regulation, war or other conflicts, weather-related events or natural disasters, actions by producers (including as part of their own sustainability efforts) or other factors beyond our control, which could have a material adverse effect on us.", "We conduct business in a number of countries, with a significant portion of our revenue derived from operations outside the United States.", "Our international operations are affected by changes in the exchange rates for local currencies, in particular the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Renminbi and Hong Kong Dollar.", "We are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on our short-term debt and that portion of our long-term debt that carries floating interest rates.", "Additionally, changes in interest rates impact the valuation of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the related costs recognized in the statements of consolidated income.", "The impact of changes in interest rates on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and costs, and on our debt, is discussed further in Part I, \"Item 7 - Critical Accounting Estimates,\" and Part II, \"Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,\" respectively, of this report.", "We monitor and manage foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate exposures, and use derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in these rates on our financial condition and results of operations; however, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates cannot always be predicted or effectively hedged, and may have a material adverse effect on us.", "Our business requires significant capital investments, including in aircraft, vehicles, technology, facilities and sortation and other equipment.", "In addition to forecasting our capital investment requirements, we adjust other elements of our operations and cost structure in response to economic and regulatory conditions, and consistent with our long-term strategy and commitments.", "These investments support both our existing business and anticipated growth.", "Forecasting amounts, types and timing of investments involves many factors which are subject to uncertainty and may be beyond our control, such as general economic trends, revenues, profitability, changes in governmental regulation and competition.", "If we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs, we could under- or over- invest, or have excess capacity or insufficient capacity, any of which would negatively affect our revenues and profitability.", "Our employee health, retiree health and pension benefit expenses are significant.", "In recent years, we have experienced significant increases in some of these costs, in particular, ongoing increases in healthcare costs in excess of the rate of inflation and historically low discount rates that we use to value our company-sponsored defined benefit plan obligations.", "Increasing healthcare costs, volatility in investment returns and discount rates, as well as changes in laws, regulations and assumptions used to calculate retiree health and pension benefit expenses, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations, and have required, and may in the future require significant contributions to our benefit plans.", "Our national master agreement with the Teamsters includes provisions that are designed to mitigate certain healthcare expenses, but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that these efforts will not materially adversely affect us.", "We participate in various trustee-managed multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements.", "As part of the overall collective bargaining process for wage and benefit levels, we have agreed to contribute certain amounts to the multiemployer benefit plans during the contract period.", "The multiemployer benefit plans set benefit levels and are responsible for benefit delivery to participants.", "Future contribution amounts to multiemployer benefit plans will be determined through collective bargaining.", "However, in future collective bargaining negotiations, we could agree to make significantly higher future contributions to one or more of these plans.", "At this time, we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions, if any, or whether any material adverse effect on us could result from our participation in these plans.", "In addition to our ongoing multiemployer pension plan obligations, we may have an obligation in the future to pay significant coordinating benefits previously earned by UPS employees in the Central States Pension Fund (the \"CSPF\").", "For additional information on our potential liabilities related to the CSPF, see note 5 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.", "We have a combination of both self-insurance and high-deductible insurance programs for the risks arising out of our business and operations, including claims exposure resulting from cargo loss, personal injury, property damage, aircraft and related liabilities, business interruption and workers' compensation.", "Self-insured workers' compensation, automobile and general liabilities are determined using actuarial estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but not reported claims, on an undiscounted basis.", "Our accruals for insurance reserves reflect certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments, which are subject to a high degree of variability.", "If the number or severity of claims for which we are retaining risk continues to increase, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.", "If we lose our ability to, or decide not to, self-insure these risks, our insurance cost could materially increase and we may find it difficult to obtain adequate levels of insurance coverage.", "We regularly assess the carrying values of our assets relative to their estimated fair values.", "The determination of fair value is dependent on a significant number of estimates and assumptions that could be impacted by a variety of factors, including changes in business strategy, revenue, expenses, government regulations, including regulation related to climate change, costs of capital and economic or market conditions.", "The use of different estimates or assumptions could also result in different estimates of fair value.", "Our estimates of fair value have resulted from time to time, and may in the future result, in substantial impairments of our assets.", "In addition, we have been and may be required in the future to recognize increased depreciation and amortization charges if we determine the useful lives or salvage values of our assets are less than we originally estimated.", "Such changes have in the past, and may in the future, reduce our net income.", "We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions.", "Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.", "There are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.", "We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in many jurisdictions.", "Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue may make resolving tax disputes more difficult.", "The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.", "In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions may materially adversely impact our tax expense and cash flows.", "We are subject to complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, security, labor, employment, safety, privacy, disclosure and data protection and other governmental laws, regulations and policies, both in the U.S. and internationally.", "In addition, we are impacted by laws, regulations and policies that affect global trade, including tariff and trade policies, export requirements, embargoes, sanctions, taxes, monetary policies and other restrictions and charges.", "Trade discussions and arrangements between the U.S. and various of its trading partners are fluid, and existing and future trade agreements are, and are expected to continue to be, subject to a number of uncertainties, including the imposition of new tariffs or adjustments and changes to the products covered by existing tariffs.", "The impact of new laws, regulations and policies or decisions or interpretations by authorities applying those laws and regulations, cannot be predicted.", "Compliance with any new laws, regulations or policies may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures.", "Any failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or policies in the U.S. or other countries could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations, which could materially adversely affect us.", "Regulation of greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions exposes us to potentially significant new taxes, fees and other costs.", "Compliance with such regulation, and any increased or additional regulation, or the associated costs is further complicated by the fact that various countries and regions may adopt different approaches to climate change regulation.", "For example, in 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization (\"ICAO\") adopted the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (\"CORSIA\"), which is a global, market-based emissions offset program to encourage carbon-neutral growth.", "A voluntary participation pilot phase began in 2021, and full mandatory participation is scheduled to begin in 2027.", "ICAO continues to develop details regarding implementation, but compliance with CORSIA will increase our operating costs.", "In the U.S., Congress has considered but, to date, not passed various bills that would regulate GHG emissions.", "Nevertheless, we believe some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future.", "Even in the absence of such legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency could determine to regulate GHG emissions, especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions, and this could impose substantial costs on us.", "In addition, the impact that the re-entry into the Paris climate accord may have on future U.S. policy regarding GHG emissions, on CORSIA and on other GHG regulation remains uncertain.", "The extent to which other countries implement that accord could also have a material adverse effect on us.", "Increased regulation relating to GHG emissions in the U.S. or abroad, especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions, could, among other things, increase the cost of fuel and other energy we purchase and the capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely.", "We cannot predict the impact any future regulation will have on our cost structure or our operating results.", "It is likely that such regulation could significantly increase our operating costs and that we may not be willing or able to pass such costs along to our customers.", "Moreover, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the GHGs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services, especially our air services.", "The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, property damage, business practices, environmental liability and other matters.", "Any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could result in significant expenditures and have a material adverse effect on us.", "For information about our executive officers, see Part III, \"Item 10.", "Directors, Executive

systems that are critical to or can significantly impact our business operations.", "These third parties are subject to risks described above, and other risks, that could damage, disrupt or close down their networks or systems.", "Security processes, protocols and standards that we implement and contractual provisions requiring security measures that we impose on such third parties may not be sufficient or effective at preventing such events or may not be adhered to.", "These events have in the past and could in the future result in unauthorized access to, or disruptions or denials of access to, misuse or disclosure of, information or systems that are important to us, including proprietary information, sensitive or confidential data, and other information about our operations, customers, employees and suppliers, including personal information.", "We have invested and expect to continue to invest in IT security initiatives, IT risk management and disaster recovery capabilities.", "The costs and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly frequent, complex and sophisticated cyber threats and regulatory requirements.", "In addition, our customers’ confidence in our ability to protect data and systems and to provide services consistent with their expectations could be impacted, further disrupting our operations.", "While we maintain cyber insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.", "Although to date we are unaware of any material data breach or cybersecurity incident, including an information system disruption, we cannot provide any assurances that such material events and impacts will not occur in the future.", "Our efforts to deter, identify, mitigate and/or eliminate future breaches or cybersecurity incidents may require significant additional effort and expense and may not be successful.", "In addition, there has recently been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus relating to the collection, use, retention, transfer, and processing of personal data in the U.S. (at both the state and federal level) and internationally, including the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, the California Privacy Rights Act, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, and other similar laws that have been or are expected to be enacted by other jurisdictions.", "In addition, China and certain other jurisdictions have enacted more stringent data localization requirements.", "An actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable data protection laws, regulations, or other data protection standards has in the past and may in the future expose us to litigation, fines, sanctions, or other penalties, which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.", "The regulatory environment is increasingly challenging, based on discretionary factors, and difficult to predict.", "Consequently, compliance with applicable regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we do business may present material obligations and risks to our business, including significantly expanded compliance burdens, costs, and enforcement risks which are expected to increase over time; require us to make extensive system or operational changes; or adversely affect the cost or attractiveness of the services we offer.", "Failure to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation could materially adversely affect us.", "Our success depends in part on our ability to maintain the image of the UPS brand and our reputation.", "Service quality issues, actual or perceived, could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customers not to use UPS services.", "Also, adverse publicity or public sentiment surrounding labor relations, environmental, sustainability and governance concerns, physical or cyber security matters, political activities and similar matters, or attempts to connect our company to such issues, either in the U.S. or elsewhere, could materially adversely affect us.", "For example, damage to our reputation or loss of brand equity could require the allocation of resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.", "The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events.", "Global climate change could materially adversely affect us.", "The effects of climate change present financial and operational risks to our business, both directly and indirectly.", "We have made public statements regarding our intended reduction of carbon emissions, including our goal to achieve carbon neutrality in our global operations by 2050 and our other short- and mid-term environmental sustainability goals.", "Our ability to meet our goals will depend in part on significant technological advancements with respect to the development and availability of reliable, affordable and sustainable alternative solutions that are outside of our control, including sustainable aviation fuel and alternative fuel vehicles.", "While we remain committed to being responsive to the effects of climate change and reducing our carbon footprint, there can be no assurances that our goals and strategic plans to achieve those goals will be successful, that the costs related to climate transition will not be higher than expected, that the necessary technological advancements will occur in the timeframe we expect, or at all, that the severity of and or the pace of negative climate-related effects will not accelerate faster than expected, or that proposed regulation or deregulation related to climate change will not have a negative competitive impact, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures or other expenses, revenue or results of operations.", "Furthermore, methodologies for reporting climate-related information may change and previously reported information may be adjusted to reflect new reporting protocols or regulations, improvements in the availability and quality of third-party data, changing assumptions, changes in the nature and scope of our operations and other changes in circumstances.", "Our processes and controls for reporting climate-related information across our operations are evolving along with multiple disparate standards for identifying, measuring and reporting sustainability metrics, including disclosures that may be required by the SEC, European and other regulators, and such standards may change over time, which could result in significant revisions to our current goals, reported progress in achieving such goals, or our ability to achieve such goals in the future.", "Changes in regulation or technology impacting our business could require us to write down the carrying value of assets, which could result in material impairment charges.", "Moreover, we may determine that it is in our best interests to prioritize other business, social, governance or sustainable investments over the achievement of our current goals based on economic, regulatory or social factors, business strategy or other factors.", "If we do not meet these goals or there is perception that we failed to meet these goals, then, in addition to regulatory and legal risks related to compliance, we could incur adverse publicity and reaction, which could adversely impact our reputation, and in turn adversely impact our results of operations.", "Severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters could materially adversely affect us.", "Weather conditions or other natural or man-made disasters and the increased severity or frequency thereof (including as a result of climate change), including storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, rising temperatures, epidemics, pandemics, conflicts, civil or political unrest, or terrorist attacks, have in the past and may in the future disrupt our business.", "Customers may reduce shipments, supply chains may be disrupted, demand may be negatively impacted or our costs to operate our business may increase, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.", "Any such event affecting one of our major facilities could result in a significant interruption in or disruption of our business.", "A potential result of climate change is more frequent or more severe weather events or natural disasters.", "To the extent such weather events or natural disasters do become more frequent or severe, disruptions to our business and those of our customers and costs to repair damaged facilities or maintain or resume operations could increase.", "Furthermore, climate change may reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance for these negative impacts of natural disasters and adverse weather conditions by contributing to an increase in the incidence and severity of such natural disasters.", "Economic, political, or social developments and other risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect us.", "We have significant international operations and, as a result, we are exposed to changing economic, political and social developments in a number of countries, all of which are beyond our control.", "Emerging markets are often more volatile than those in other countries, and any broad-based downturn in these markets could reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "We are subject to many laws governing our international operations, including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and commercial customers, govern our environmental impact or labor matters, and restrict where we can do business, our shipments to certain countries and the information that we can provide to non-U.S. governments.", "Our failure to manage and anticipate these and other risks associated with our international operations could materially adversely affect us.", "Our inability to effectively integrate any acquired businesses and realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances or dispositions could materially adversely affect us.", "From time to time we acquire businesses, form joint ventures and strategic alliances, and dispose of operations.", "Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends, in part, upon successful integration between the businesses involved, the performance of the underlying operations, capabilities or technologies and the management of the acquired operations.", "Accordingly, our financial results could be materially adversely affected by our failure to effectively integrate acquired operations, unanticipated performance or other issues or transaction-related charges.", "Changing fuel and energy prices, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, and interruptions in supplies of these commodities could materially adversely affect us.", "Fuel and energy costs have a significant impact on our operations.", "We require significant quantities of fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risks associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.", "We seek to mitigate our exposure to changing fuel prices through our pricing strategy and may utilize hedging transactions from time to time.", "There can be no assurance that this strategy will be effective.", "If we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges, higher fuel costs could materially adversely impact our operating results.", "Even if we are able to offset changes in fuel costs with surcharges, high fuel surcharges have in the past, and may in the future result in a shift from our higher-yielding products to lower-yielding products or an overall reduction in volume, revenue and profitability.", "Moreover, we could experience a disruption in energy supplies as a result of new or increased regulation, war or other conflicts, weather-related events or natural disasters, actions by producers (including as part of their own sustainability efforts) or other factors beyond our control, which could have a material adverse effect on us.",

derived from operations outside the United States.", "Our international operations are affected by changes in the exchange rates for local currencies, in particular the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Renminbi and Hong Kong Dollar.", "We are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on our short-term debt and that portion of our long-term debt that carries floating interest rates.", "Additionally, changes in interest rates impact the valuation of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the related costs recognized in the statements of consolidated income.", "The impact of changes in interest rates on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and costs, and on our debt, is discussed further in Part I, \"Item 7 - Critical Accounting Estimates,\" and Part II, \"Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\", respectively, of this report.", "We monitor and manage foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate exposures, and use derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in these rates on our financial condition and results of operations; however, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates cannot always be predicted or effectively hedged, and may have a material adverse effect on us.", "Our business requires significant capital and other investments; if we do not accurately forecast our future investment needs, we could be materially adversely affected.", "Our business requires significant capital investments, including in aircraft, vehicles, technology, facilities and sortation and other equipment.", "In addition to forecasting our capital investment requirements, we adjust other elements of our operations and cost structure in response to economic and regulatory conditions.", "These investments support both our existing business and anticipated growth.", "Forecasting amounts, types and timing of investments involves many factors which are subject to uncertainty and may be beyond our control, such as general economic trends, revenues, profitability, changes in governmental regulation and competition.", "If we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs, we could under- or over-invest, or have excess capacity or insufficient capacity, any of which could negatively affect our revenues and profitability.", "Employee health and retiree health and pension benefit costs represent a significant expense to us; further cost increases could materially adversely affect us.", "Our employee health, retiree health and pension benefit expenses are significant.", "In recent years, we have experienced increases in some of these costs, in particular, ongoing increases in healthcare costs in excess of the rate of inflation and historically low discount rates that we use to value our company-sponsored defined benefit plan obligations.", "Increasing healthcare costs, volatility in investment returns and discount rates, as well as changes in laws, regulations and assumptions used to calculate retiree health and pension benefit expenses, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations, and have required, and may in the future require significant contributions to our benefit plans.", "Our national master agreement with the Teamsters includes provisions that are designed to mitigate certain healthcare expenses, but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that these efforts will not materially adversely affect us.", "We participate in various trustee-managed multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements.", "As part of the overall collective bargaining process for wage and benefit levels, we have agreed to contribute certain amounts to the multiemployer benefit plans during the contract period.", "The multiemployer benefit plans set benefit levels and are responsible for benefit delivery to participants.", "Future contribution amounts to multiemployer benefit plans will be determined through collective bargaining.", "However, in future collective bargaining negotiations, we could agree to make significantly higher future contributions to one or more of these plans.", "At this time, we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions, if any, or whether any material adverse effect on us could result from our participation in these plans.", "In addition to our ongoing multiemployer pension plan obligations, we may have an obligation in the future to pay significant coordinating benefits previously earned by UPS employees in the Central States Pension Fund (the \"CSPF\").", "For additional information on our potential liabilities related to the CSPF, see note 5 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.", "Insurance and claims expense could materially adversely affect us.", "We have a combination of both self-insurance and high-deductible insurance programs for the risks arising out of our business and operations, including claims exposure resulting from cargo loss, personal injury, property damage, aircraft and related liabilities, business interruption and workers' compensation.", "Self-insured workers' compensation, automobile and general liabilities are determined using actuarial estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but not reported claims, on an undiscounted basis.", "Our accruals for insurance reserves reflect certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments, which are subject to a high degree of variability.", "If the number, severity or cost of claims for which we retain risk continues to increase, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.", "If we lose our ability to, or decide not to, self-insure these risks, our insurance cost could materially increase and we may find it difficult to obtain adequate levels of insurance coverage.", "Changes in markets and our business plans have resulted, and may in the future result, in substantial impairments of the carrying value of our assets, thereby reducing our net income.", "We regularly assess the carrying values of our assets relative to their estimated fair values.", "If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value, we may be required to incur charges to reduce the carrying value thereof.", "The determination of fair value is dependent on a significant number of estimates and assumptions that could be impacted by a variety of factors, including changes in business strategy, revenue, expenses, government regulations, including regulation related to climate change, costs of capital and economic or market conditions.", "The use of different estimates or assumptions could also result in different estimates of fair value.", "Our estimates of fair value have resulted from time to time, and may in the future result, in substantial impairments of our assets.", "For example, during the year ended December 31, 2023, as a result of a number of factors including changes in business strategy and challenging macroeconomic conditions such as increases in the risk-free interest rate and volatility of the stock prices of market comparables, we incurred impairment charges of $125 and $111 million in respect of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively.", "In addition, we have been and may be required in the future to recognize increased depreciation and amortization charges if we determine the useful lives or salvage values of our assets are less than we originally estimated.", "Such changes have in the past, and may in the future, reduce our net income.", "We may have significant additional tax liabilities that could materially adversely affect us.", "We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions.", "Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.", "There are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.", "We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in many jurisdictions.", "Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue may make resolving tax disputes more difficult.", "The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.", "In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions may materially adversely impact our tax expense and cash flows.", "Increasingly complex and stringent laws, regulations and policies could materially increase our operating costs.", "We are subject to complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, security, labor, employment, safety, privacy, disclosure and data protection and other governmental laws, regulations and policies, both in the U.S. and internationally.", "In addition, we are impacted by laws, regulations and policies that affect global trade, including tariff and trade policies, export requirements, embargoes, sanctions, taxes, monetary policies and other restrictions and charges.", "Trade discussions and arrangements between the U.S. and various of its trading partners are fluid, and existing and future trade agreements are, and are expected to continue to be, subject to a number of uncertainties, including the imposition of new tariffs or adjustments and changes to the products covered by existing tariffs.", "The impact of new laws, regulations and policies or decisions or interpretations by authorities applying those laws and regulations, cannot be predicted.", "Compliance with any new laws, regulations or policies may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures.", "Any failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or policies in the U.S. or other countries could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations, which could materially adversely affect us.", "Increasingly stringent regulations related to climate change, including reporting obligations, could materially increase our operating costs.", "Regulation and required disclosures of greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions and related matters exposes us to potentially significant new taxes, fees, disclosure and compliance obligations and other costs.", "Compliance with such regulation, and any increased or additional regulation, or the associated costs is further complicated by the fact that various countries and regions may adopt different approaches to climate change regulation and disclosures.", "For example, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (\"CORSIA\"), a global, market-based emissions offset program to encourage carbon-neutral growth began a voluntary pilot phase in 2021, with mandatory participation scheduled to begin in 2027.", "The International Civil Aviation Organization, which adopted CORSIA, continues to develop details regarding implementation, but compliance with CORSIA is expected to increase our operating costs, potentially significantly.", "In the U.S., Congress has considered but, to date, not passed various bills that would regulate GHG emissions.", "Nevertheless, we believe some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future.", "Even in the absence of such legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency could determine to regulate GHG emissions, especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions, and this could impose substantial costs on us.", "In addition, the impact that participation in the Paris Climate Accords may have on future U.S. policy regarding GHG emissions, on CORSIA and on other GHG regulation remains uncertain.", "The extent to which other countries implement that accord could also have a material adverse effect on us.", "Increased regulation relating to GHG emissions in the U.S. or abroad, especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions, could, among other things, increase the cost of fuel and other energy we purchase and the capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely.", "We cannot predict the impact any future regulation will have on our cost structure or our operating results.", "It is likely that such regulation could significantly increase our operating costs and that we may not be willing or able to pass such costs along to our customers.", "Moreover, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the GHGs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services, especially our air services.", "Furthermore, many countries, as well as U.S. states, in which we operate or are subject to regulation have adopted, or are expected to adopt, additional requirements relating to the disclosure of GHG emissions and related matters.", "In many cases these requirements differ and may conflict from country to country.", "Compliance with these disclosure requirements may increase our operating costs or require significant management time and attention.", "Any failure to comply with applicable disclosure regulations in the U.S. (at either the federal or state level) or other countries could result in substantial fines or other penalties, which could materially adversely affect us.", "We may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures which may materially adversely affect us.", "The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, property damage, business practices, environmental liability and other matters.", "Any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could result in significant expenditures and have a material adverse effect on us.", "For information about our executive officers, see Part III, \"Item 10.", "Directors, Executive

"We consider and evaluate cybersecurity risks associated with the use of independent third-party service providers.", "To help UPS understand and mitigate potential cybersecurity risks, we generally utilize measures such as vendor risk assessments, periodic technical assessments of third-party vendors' controls and contracts governing the use of and access to our data and compliance with our security requirements.", "We maintain an Incident Response Plan that includes processes and procedures for reviewing and responding to cybersecurity incidents.", "We periodically test our readiness to respond to a cybersecurity incident through various scenario-based drills.", "The Incident Response Plan includes processes for escalation to the CISO, the Executive Leadership Team, including the
