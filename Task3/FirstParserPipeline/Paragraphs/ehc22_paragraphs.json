In 2023, we plan to open 8 hospitals (approximately 395 beds) and add 80 to 100 beds to existing hospitals. We also believe we will continue to have organic growth opportunities based on our track record of growth, planned bed additions at a number of existing hospitals, and the maturation of newly opened locations.", "•       Operational Initiatives. Our priorities include operational initiatives that build on momentum from recent years. We believe our care coordination efforts have and will continue to contribute to reductions in discharges to skilled nursing facilities, higher discharges to community, and improved patient experience.

Medicare Advantage payors represented 8.4% of our net operating revenues in 2017 and 15.1% in 2022. We believe our outcomes and quality of care data have helped drive a significant improvement in the payments we receive from Medicare Advantage payors. For example, reimbursement based on the type of patient/treatment required, commonly referred to as the case mix group basis (“CMG”), is typically greater than reimbursement on a per-diem rate basis, and we increased the percentage of our Medicare Advantage revenue paid based on CMG from approximately 58% in 2017 to approximately 88% in 2022.", "Given the significant number of stroke patients in need of post-acute care, we will continue working to build our stroke market share through our strategic sponsorship of the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association, the IRF treatment", "recommendations published by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs and the Journal of the American Medical Association, our care coordination, and our hospitals’ participation in The Joint Commission’s Disease-Specific Care Certification Program.

Our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals", "compete primarily with rehabilitation units, most of which are within acute-care hospitals, in the markets we serve. An acute-care hospital operating its own unit, particularly one owned or operated by a large public company or not-for-profit that has a dominant position in the local market, can be a formidable competitor because 91% of our patients come from acute-care hospitals. There are several privately held companies offering post-acute rehabilitation services that compete with us primarily in select geographic markets. In addition, there is a public company that is primarily focused on other post-acute care services but also operates 31 freestanding inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. Other providers of post-acute care services compete for some rehabilitation patients. For example, nursing homes may market themselves as offering certain rehabilitation services, particularly to patients not in need of intensive rehabilitation therapy, even though those nursing homes are not required to offer the same level of care, and are not licensed, as hospitals. The primary competitive factors in any given market include the quality of care and service provided, the treatment outcomes achieved, the relationship and reputation with managed care and other private payors and the acute-care hospitals, physicians, or other referral sources in the market, and the regulatory barriers to entry in certificate of need states. The ability to work as part of an integrated delivery payment model with other providers, including the ability to deliver quality patient outcomes and cost-effective care, could become an increasingly important factor in competition if a significant number of people in a market are participants in one or more of these models. See the “Regulation—Relationships with Physicians and Other Providers” and “Regulation—Certificates of Need” sections below for further discussion of some of these factors. For a list of our inpatient rehabilitation markets by state, see the table in Item 2, Properties.", "Healthcare is a highly regulated industry facing many well-publicized regulatory and reimbursement challenges driven by escalating", "costs and the pursuit of better quality of care. The Medicare reimbursement system for inpatient rehabilitation has changed significantly over the years. The future of many aspects of healthcare regulation remains uncertain. Any regulatory or legislative changes impacting the healthcare industry ultimately may affect, among other things, reimbursement of healthcare providers, consumers’ access to coverage of health services, including among non-Medicare aged population segments within commercial insurance markets and Medicaid enrollees, and competition among providers. Changes may also affect the delivery of healthcare services to patients by providers and the regulatory compliance obligations associated with those services.", "Successful healthcare providers are those able to adapt to changes in the regulatory and operating environments, build strategic relationships across the healthcare continuum, and consistently provide high-quality, cost-effective care.

For more in-depth discussion of the primary challenges and risks related to our business, particularly the changes in Medicare reimbursement, increased compliance and enforcement burdens, and changes to our operating environment resulting from healthcare reform, see “Sources of Revenues—Medicare Reimbursement” and “Regulation” below in this section as well as Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Executive Overview—Key Challenges.”", "We receive payment for patient care services from the federal government (primarily under the Medicare program), managed care", "plans and private insurers, and, to a considerably lesser degree, state governments (under their respective Medicaid or similar programs) and directly from patients. Revenues and receivables from Medicare are significant to our operations. The federal and state governments establish payment rates as described in more detail below. We negotiate the payment rates with non-governmental group purchasers of healthcare services that are included in “Managed care” in the tables below, including private insurance companies, employers, health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”), preferred provider organizations (“PPOs”), and other managed care plans. Patients are generally not responsible for the difference between established gross charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, and other private insurance plans, HMOs, or PPOs but are responsible to the extent of any exclusions, deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance features of their coverage. Medicare, through its Medicare Advantage program, offers Medicare-eligible individuals an opportunity to participate in managed care plans. Revenues from Medicare and Medicare Advantage represent approximately 80% of total revenues.", "The sources and relative mix of our revenues for the last three years are:", "Medicare is a federal program that provides hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged 65 and over, qualified disabled", "persons, and persons with end-stage renal disease. Medicare, through statutes and regulations, establishes reimbursement methodologies and rates for various types of healthcare providers, facilities, and services. Each year, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (“MedPAC”), an independent agency that advises the United States Congress on issues affecting Medicare, makes payment policy recommendations to", "Congress for a variety of Medicare payment systems including, among others, the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system", "(the “IRF-PPS”). MedPAC also makes recommendations on regulatory actions to CMS. Neither Congress nor CMS is obligated to adopt MedPAC recommendations, and, based on outcomes in previous years, there can be no assurance either will adopt MedPAC’s recommendations in a given year. However, MedPAC’s recommendations have, and could in the future, become the basis for subsequent legislative or, as discussed below, regulatory action.", "The Medicare statutes are subject to change from time to time. With respect to Medicare reimbursement, the ACA provides for", "specific reductions to healthcare providers’ annual market basket updates and other payment policy changes. In August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011 providing for an automatic 2% reduction, or “sequestration,” of Medicare program payments for all healthcare providers. Sequestration took effect April 1, 2013 and, as a result of subsequent legislation, will continue through mid-fiscal year 2032 unless Congress and the President take further action. In response to the public health emergency associated with the pandemic, Congress and the President suspended sequestration through March 31, 2022. Additional Medicare payment reductions are also possible under the Statutory Pay-As-", "You-Go Act of 2010 (“Statutory PAYGO”). Statutory PAYGO requires, among other things, that mandatory spending and revenue legislation not increase the federal budget deficit over a 5- or 10-year period. If the Office of Management and Budget (the “OMB”) finds there is a deficit in the federal budget, Statutory PAYGO requires OMB to order sequestration of Medicare. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 would result in budget deficits necessitating a 4% reduction in Medicare program payments under the Statutory PAYGO, but subsequent legislation enacted by Congress suspended until 2025 the Statutory PAYGO reductions that would have gone into effect. In the future, concerns about the federal deficit, national debt levels and the solvency of the Medicare trust fund could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions, further entitlement reform legislation affecting the Medicare program, or both. Healthcare will almost certainly be the subject of significant regulatory and legislative changes regardless of the party in control of the executive and legislative branches of state and federal governments.", "From time to time, Medicare regulations, including reimbursement methodologies and rates, can be further modified by CMS. Subject to its statutory authority, CMS may make some prospective payment system changes. For example, CMS changed the IRF-PPS, effective October 1, 2019, to replace the FIM™ assessment instrument with new patient assessment measures, which we refer to as “Section GG functional measures” or “Section GG” based on the designation CMS assigned to them. Section GG affects patients’ classification into case-mix groupings, relative weights, and length-of-stay values under the IRF-PPS, which in turn affect our reimbursement amounts. In some instances, CMS’s modifications can have a substantial impact on healthcare providers. In accordance with Medicare laws and statutes, CMS makes annual adjustments to Medicare payment rates in prospective payment systems, including the IRF-PPS, by what is commonly known as a “market basket update.” CMS may take other regulatory action affecting rates as well. For example, under the ACA, CMS requires IRFs to submit data on certain quality of care measures for the IRF quality reporting program. A facility’s failure to submit the required quality data results in a two percentage point reduction to that facility’s annual market basket increase factor for payments made for discharges in a subsequent Medicare fiscal year. IRFs began submitting quality data to CMS in October 2012. All of our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals have met the reporting deadlines to date resulting in no corresponding reimbursement reductions.", "We cannot predict the adjustments to Medicare payment rates Congress or CMS may make in the future. Congress, MedPAC, and CMS will continue to address reimbursement rates for a variety of healthcare settings. Any additional downward adjustment to rates or limitations on reimbursement for the types of facilities we operate and services we provide could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For additional discussion of the risks associated with our concentration of revenues from the federal government or with potential changes to the statutes or regulations governing Medicare reimbursement, see", "Although reductions or changes in reimbursement from governmental or third-party payors and regulatory changes affecting our", "business represent one of the most significant challenges to our business, our operations are also affected by other rules and regulations that indirectly affect reimbursement for our services, such as data coding rules and patient coverage rules and determinations. For example, Medicare providers like us can be negatively affected by the adoption of coverage policies, either at the national or local level, that determine whether an item or service is covered and under what clinical circumstances it is considered to be reasonable and necessary. Current CMS coverage rules require inpatient rehabilitation services to be ordered by a physician and be coordinated by an interdisciplinary team and the admission to the IRF must be reviewed and approved by a specialized rehabilitation physician. The interdisciplinary team must meet weekly to review patient status and make any needed adjustments to the individualized plan of care. Qualified personnel must provide the rehabilitation nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, social services, psychological services, and prosthetic and orthotic services that may be needed. Medicare contractors processing claims for CMS make coverage determinations regarding medical necessity that can represent novel or restrictive interpretations of the CMS coverage rules. Those interpretations are not made through a notice and comment review process. We cannot predict how future CMS coverage rule interpretations or any new local coverage determinations will affect us. However, more restrictive coverage interpretations can limit or delay our reimbursement for services provided to potentially large pools of patients with similar medical conditions.", "In the ordinary course, Medicare reimbursement claims made by healthcare providers, including inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, are", "subject to audit from time to time by governmental payors and their agents, such as the Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MACs”) that act as fiscal intermediaries for all Medicare billings, as well as the United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (the “HHS-OIG”), CMS, and state Medicaid programs. In addition to those audits conducted by existing MACs, CMS has developed and instituted various Medicare audit programs under which CMS contracts with private companies to conduct claims and medical record audits. Some contractors are paid a percentage of the overpayments recovered. The Recovery Audit Contractors (“RACs”) conduct payment reviews of claims, which can examine coding, overall billing accuracy, and medical necessity. When conducting an audit, the RACs receive claims data directly from MACs on a monthly or quarterly basis.", "CMS has also established Unified Program Integrity Contractors (“UPICs”), previously known as Zone Program Integrity Contractors, to perform fraud, waste, and abuse detection, deterrence and prevention activities for Medicare and Medicaid claims. Like the RACs, the UPICs conduct audits and have the ability to refer matters to the HHS-OIG or the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”). Unlike RACs, however, UPICs do not receive a specific financial incentive based on the amount of the payment errors they identify.", "As a matter of course, we undertake significant efforts through training, education, and documentation to ensure compliance with", "coding and medical necessity coverage rules. Despite our efforts to ensure accurate coding and assessment of patients, audits may lead to assertions that we have been underpaid or overpaid by Medicare or that we have submitted improper claims in some instances. Audits may also require us to incur additional costs to respond to requests for records and defend the validity of payments and claims, and ultimately require us to refund any amounts determined to have been overpaid. We cannot predict when or how these audit programs will affect us. Any denial of a claim for payment, either as a result of an audit or ordinary course payment review by the MAC, is subject to an appeals process that can take years to complete. For additional discussion of these audits and the risks associated with them, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Executive Overview—Key Challenges.”", "In response to the public health emergency associated with the pandemic, Congress and CMS adopted several statutory and", "regulatory measures intended to provide relief to healthcare providers in order to ensure patients would continue to have adequate access to care.

The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (the “2021 Budget Act”), signed into law on December 27, 2020, provided for additional provider relief funds. We did not accept any provider relief funds.", "As noted above, our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals receive a fixed payment reimbursement amount per discharge under the IRFPPS based on the patient’s rehabilitation impairment category and other characteristics and conditions identified by the attending clinicians. In order to qualify for reimbursement under the IRF-PPS, our hospitals must comply with various Medicare rules and regulations including documentation and coverage requirements, or specifications as to what conditions must be met to qualify for reimbursement. These requirements relate to, among other things, pre-admission screening, and individual treatment planning that all delineate the role of physicians in ordering and overseeing patient care. For example, a physician must approve admission of each patient and in doing so determine that the treatment of the patient in an IRF setting is reasonable and necessary. In addition, to qualify as an IRF under Medicare rules, a facility must be primarily focused on treating patients with one of 13 specified medical conditions that typically require intensive therapy and supervision, such as stroke, brain injury, hip fracture, certain neurological conditions, and spinal cord injury. Specifically, at least 60% of a facility’s patients must have a diagnosis or qualifying comorbidity from at least one of these 13 conditions, which requirement is known as the “60% Rule.” Also, each patient admitted to an IRF must be able to tolerate a minimum of three hours of therapy per day for five days per week and must have a registered nurse available 24 hours, each day of the week.", "Under IRF-PPS, CMS is required to adjust the payment rates based on an IRF-specific market basket index.

In setting annual market basket updates, CMS uses data furnished by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for price proxy purposes, primarily in three categories: Producer Price Indexes, Consumer Price Indexes, and Employment Cost Indexes. With IRF-PPS, our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals retain the difference, if any, between the fixed payment from Medicare and their operating costs. Accordingly, our hospitals benefit from being costeffective providers.", "On July 29, 2021, CMS released its notice of final rulemaking for fiscal year 2022 IRF-PPS (the “2022 IRF Rule”).

As the Medicaid program is administered by the individual states under the oversight of CMS in accordance with certain regulatory and statutory guidelines, there are substantial differences in reimbursement methodologies and coverage policies from state to state. Many states have experienced shortfalls in their Medicaid budgets and are implementing significant cuts in Medicaid reimbursement rates. Additionally, certain states control Medicaid expenditures through restricting or eliminating coverage of some services. Continuing downward pressure on Medicaid payment rates could cause a decline in that portion of our Net operating revenues. However, for the year ended December 31, 2022, Medicaid payments represented only 4.2% of our consolidated Net operating revenues.

Another example is CMS’s implementation of the new patient assessment measures for IRFs discussed below. The IMPACT Act also creates additional data reporting requirements for our hospitals.

A PAC-PPS would rely on “site neutral” reimbursement based on patients’ medical conditions and other clinical factors rather than the care settings. MedPAC found a PAC-PPS to be feasible and desirable but also suggested many existing regulatory requirements, including, for IRFs, the 60% rule discussed below and the requirement for a minimum of three hours of therapy per day, should be waived or modified as part of implementing a PAC-PPS. MedPAC previously estimated, although we cannot verify the methodology or the accuracy of that estimate, a PAC-PPS would result in a 15% reduction in IRF reimbursements. As a precursor to a PAC-PPS, MedPAC discussed in November 2017 a potential recommendation to change the case-mix weights in each postacute setting for 2019 and 2020 to a blend of the current setting specific weight and the proposed PAC-PPS weight, which MedPAC suggested would shift money from for-profit and freestanding IRFs to non-profit and hospital-based IRFs.

In many cases, the new reporting requirements are linked to reimbursement incentives. For example, under the ACA, CMS established new quality data reporting, effective October 1, 2012, for all IRFs. A facility’s failure to submit the required quality data results in a two percentage point reduction to that facility’s annual market basket increase factor for payments made for discharges in the subsequent Medicare fiscal year. Hospitals began submitting quality data to CMS in October 2012. All of our hospitals have met the reporting deadlines to date resulting in no corresponding reimbursement reductions.", "As noted above, the IMPACT Act mandated that CMS adopt several new quality reporting measures for the various post-acute", "provider types.

As noted above, the clarity and completeness of each patient medical file, some of which is the work product of a physician not employed by us, is essential to successfully challenging any payment denials. If the physicians working with our patients do not adequately document, among other things, their diagnoses and plans of care, our risks related to audits and payment denials in general are greater. Depending on the nature of the conduct found in such audits and whether the underlying conduct could be considered systemic, the resolution of these audits could have a material adverse effect in the aggregate on our financial position, results of operation, cash flows, and liquidity.", "In the context of our inpatient rehabilitation business, one of the common grounds cited for denying a claim or challenging a", "previously paid Medicare claim in an audit is that the patient’s treatment in a hospital was not medically necessary. The medical record must support that both the documentation and coverage criteria requirements are met for the hospital stay to be considered medically necessary. Medical necessity is an assessment by an independent physician of a patient’s ability to tolerate and benefit from intensive multi-disciplinary therapy provided in an IRF setting. A Medicare claim may be denied or challenged based on an opinion of the auditor that the record did not evidence medical necessity for treatment in an IRF or lacked sufficient documentation to support the conclusion. Some MACs have in the past applied and are likely in the future to apply their own unique interpretation of CMS coverage rules or impose otherwise arbitrary conditions not set out in the related rules, which has resulted and may in the future result in payment denials.", "In some cases, we believe the reviewing party is not merely challenging the sufficiency of the medical record but is substituting its", "judgment of medical necessity for that of the attending physician or imposing documentation or other requirements that are not set out in the regulations.

The TPE program includes up to three rounds of claims review with corresponding provider education and a subsequent period to allow for improvement. If results do not improve sufficiently after three rounds, the MAC may refer the provider to CMS for further action, which may include extrapolation of error rates to a broader universe of claims or referral to a UPIC or RAC (defined below). As of December 31, 2022, none of our hospitals have progressed beyond the third round of reviews, so it is unclear how the review process after TPE would proceed.

These audits are in addition to those conducted by existing MACs. Some contractors are paid a percentage of the overpayments recovered. One type of audit contractor, the Recovery Audit Contractors (“RACs”), receive claims data directly from MACs on a monthly or quarterly basis and are authorized to review previously paid claims. RAC audits of IRFs have focused on reviews of patient coding, medical necessity, and billing accuracy. CMS has, however, authorized RACs to conduct complex reviews of the medical records associated with IRF reimbursement claims. CMS has previously operated a demonstration project that expanded the RAC program to include prepayment review of Medicare fee-for-service claims from primarily acute-care hospitals. It is unclear whether CMS intends to conduct RAC prepayment reviews in the future and if so, what providers and claims would be the focus of those reviews.", "CMS has also established contractors known as the Uniform Program Integrity Contractors (“UPICs,” formerly known as Zone Program Integrity Contractors).

Unlike RACs, however, UPICs do not receive a specific financial incentive based on the amount of the error. In December 2017, we received notice of a UPIC audit at one of our hospitals. The UPIC sampled 100 claims and challenged the propriety of a subset of the sample representing $1.3 million in previously paid claims.

Providers participating in BPCI Advanced are subject to a semi-annual reconciliation process where CMS compares the aggregate Medicare expenditures for all items and services included in a clinical episode against the target price for that type of episode to determine whether the participant is eligible to receive a portion of the savings, or is required to repay a portion of the payment above target.

The CJR originally was mandatory for the acute-care hospitals in the 67 geographic areas covered. On November 30, 2017, CMS issued a final rule making the CJR voluntary in 33 of those areas. The CJR model’s original five-year term ended in December 2020, but CMS extended the model through 2024 for most providers in the 34 geographic areas with mandatory participation. Under CJR, healthcare providers in the mandatory participation areas are paid under existing Medicare payment systems. However, CMS holds the acute-care hospital where a joint replacement takes place accountable for the quality and costs of care for the entire episode of care — from the time of the original admission through 90 days after discharge. Depending on the quality and cost performance during the entire episode, the acute-care hospital may receive an additional payment or be required to repay Medicare a portion of the episode costs. As a result, CMS believes acute-care hospitals are incented to work with physicians and post-acute care providers to ensure beneficiaries receive the coordinated care they need in an efficient manner. Acute-care hospitals participating in the CJR model may enter into risk-sharing financial arrangements with post-acute providers, including IRFs. CJR has not had a material impact on our hospitals.", "HHS and CMS continue to explore ways to encourage and facilitate increased participation in alternative payment models and value-", "based purchasing initiatives.

The bundling and ACO initiatives have served as motivating factors for regulators and healthcare industry participants to identify and implement workable coordinated care and integrated payment models. Broad-based implementation of a new payment model would represent a significant transformation for us and the healthcare industry generally. The nature and timing of the evolution or transformation of the current healthcare system to coordinated care delivery and integrated payment models and value-based purchasing remain uncertain. The development of new delivery and payment systems will almost certainly take significant time and expense. Many of the alternative approaches, including those discussed above, being explored may not work or could change substantially prior to any nationwide implementations.

The intent of tracking and publishing this data is to evaluate a given provider’s payment efficiency relative to the efficiency of the national median provider in that provider’s post-acute segment. CMS believes this measure will encourage improved efficiency and coordination of care in the post-acute setting by holding providers accountable for Medicare resource use during an episode of care. However, the measures may be misleading as they do not incorporate patient outcomes associated with those resources used. CMS has not proposed to compare payment efficiency across provider segments.", "On December 14, 2020, CMS announced the proposal of a five-year review choice demonstration for inpatient rehabilitation services (the “IRF RCD”). CMS plans to implement the demonstration in Alabama, and then expand to Pennsylvania, Texas, and California. The proposed timing of this demonstration is not known. We operate 46 inpatient rehabilitation hospitals (representing approximately 32% of our IRF Medicare claims) in those four states. After the initial four states, CMS intends to expand the demonstration to include additional IRFs based on the Medicare Administrative Contractor to which those IRFs submit claims. Under the demonstration, participating IRFs would have an initial choice between pre-claim or post-payment review of 100% of claims submitted to demonstrate compliance with applicable Medicare coverage and clinical documentation requirements. Under the pre-claim review choice, services could begin prior to the submission of the review request and continue while the decision is being made. The pre-claim review request with required documentation must be submitted and reviewed before the final claim is submitted for payment. Under the post-payment review choice, IRFs would provide services, submit all claims for payment following their normal processes, and then submit required documentation for medical review. If 90% or more of its claims are found to be valid, the IRF may then opt out of the RCD review, except for spot reviews of samples consisting of 5% of total claims.

CMS has also taken the position that a patient’s medical file must appropriately document the rationale for the use of group therapies, as opposed to one-on-one therapy. Beginning on October 1, 2015, CMS instituted a new data collection requirement pursuant to which IRFs must capture the minutes and mode (individual, group, concurrent, or co-treatment) of therapy by specialty.

However, that HHS-OIG report involved an extremely small sample size, was not a random sample of cases, included some citations to coverage requirements that did not match actual regulations, appeared to conflate technical documentation requirements with medical necessity determinations, and was at odds with actual MAC reviews of claims during that same timeframe which found substantially lower error rates. On September 15, 2022, the HHS-OIG updated its work plan to conduct a nationwide audit of IRF claims in order to determine the extent to which CMS could clarify the Medicare IRF claim payment criteria. The HHS-OIG expects to issue a report on this in fiscal year 2024.

However, we ultimately do not and cannot control the physicians’ medical judgment. In connection with subsequent payment audits and investigations, there can be no assurance as to what opinion a third party may take regarding the status of patient files or the physicians’ medical judgment evidenced in those files.", " On March 4, 2013, we received document subpoenas from an office of the HHS-OIG addressed to four of our hospitals. On April 24, 2014, we received document subpoenas relating to an additional seven of our hospitals. Those subpoenas requested documents, including copies of patient medical records, related to reimbursement claims submitted during periods ranging from January 2008 through December 2013. The associated investigation led by DOJ was based on whistleblower claims of alleged improper or fraudulent claims submitted to Medicare and Medicaid and requested documents and materials relating to practices, procedures, protocols and policies of certain pre- and post-admissions activities at these hospitals including marketing functions, pre-admission screening, post-admission physician evaluations, patient assessment instruments, individualized patient plans of care, and compliance with the Medicare 60% rule. Under the Medicare rule commonly referred to as the “60% Rule,” 60% or more of the patients of an IRF must have at least one of a specified list of medical conditions in order to be reimbursed at the IRF-PPS payment rates, rather than at the lower acute-care hospital payment rates. We settled the DOJ investigation, together with the related qui tam or whistleblower lawsuits, in 2019 for a total payment of $48 million. In return for the settlement payment, the plaintiffs dismissed with prejudice their pending qui tam claims, and DOJ provided Encompass Health and all its subsidiaries with a release from civil liability.", "Although we have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial time, effort, and expense in implementing and maintaining", "training programs as well as internal controls and procedures designed to ensure regulatory compliance, we have in the past been, and could in the future be, required to return portions of reimbursements for discharges alleged after the fact to have not been appropriate under the applicable reimbursement rules and change our patient admissions practices going forward. We could also be subjected to other liabilities, including (1) criminal penalties, (2) civil penalties, including monetary penalties and the loss of our licenses to operate one or more of our hospitals, and (3) exclusion or suspension of one or more of our hospitals from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal and state healthcare programs, which, if lengthy in duration and material to us, could potentially trigger a default under our credit agreement or debt instruments.", "Because Medicare comprises a significant portion of our Net operating revenues, failure to comply with the laws and regulations", "governing the Medicare program and related matters, including anti-kickback and anti-fraud requirements, could materially and adversely affect us. As discussed above in connection with the ACA, the federal government has in the last couple of years made compliance enforcement and fighting healthcare fraud top priorities. In the past few years, DOJ and HHS as well as federal lawmakers have significantly increased efforts to ensure strict compliance with various reimbursement related regulations as well as combat healthcare fraud. DOJ has pursued and recovered record amounts based on alleged healthcare fraud. The increased enforcement efforts have frequently included aggressive arguments and interpretations of laws and regulations that pose risks for all providers. For example, the federal government has increasingly asserted that incidents of", "erroneous billing or record keeping may represent violations of the FCA. Human error and oversight in record keeping and documentation, particularly where those activities are the responsibility of non-employees, are always a risk in business, and healthcare providers and independent physicians are not immune to this risk. Additionally, the federal government has been willing to challenge the medical judgment of independent physicians in determining issues such as the medical necessity of a given treatment plan.", "Settlements of alleged violations or imposed reductions in reimbursements, substantial damages and other remedies assessed against", "us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

Our ability to operate in a compliant manner impacts the claims denials, compliance enforcement, and regulatory processes discussed in other risks above. The federal government’s reliance on sub-regulatory guidance, such as handbooks, FAQs, internal memoranda, and press releases, presents a unique challenge to compliance efforts. Such sub-regulatory guidance purports to explain validly promulgated regulations but often expands or supplements existing regulations without constitutionally and statutorily required notice and comment and other procedural protections. Without procedural protections, sub-regulatory guidance poses a risk above and beyond reasonable efforts to follow validly promulgated regulations, particularly when the agency or MAC seeking to enforce such sub-regulatory guidance is not the agency or MAC issuing the guidance and therefore not as familiar with the substance and nature of the underlying regulations or even clinical issues involved.", "On August 6, 2020, CMS issued a proposed rule invoking a rarely used retroactive-rulemaking authority to support CMS’s", "application of a Medicare payment methodology that the U.S. Supreme Court found to be procedurally improper in Azar v. Allina Health Services in 2019. CMS’ invocation of its retroactive-rulemaking authority in response to this Supreme Court decision is an unfavorable precedent for providers because it demonstrates a willingness by CMS to revive adverse reimbursement actions after those actions are deemed deficient on administrative procedural grounds.", "Additionally, the federal government is increasingly turning to statistical sampling and extrapolation to expand claims denials and", "enforcement efforts and advocate for changes in reimbursement policy. Through sampling and extrapolation, the government takes a review of a small number of reimbursement claims and generalizes the results of that review to a much broader universe of claims, which can result in significant increases in the aggregate number and value of claims at issue. Increasing use of extrapolation can be found in payment review audits, such as those conducted by RACs and UPICs. In addition to payment reviews, government agencies may allege compliance violations, including submission of false claims, based on sampling and extrapolation and seek to change reimbursement policy. For example, the HHSOIG issued a report in September 2018 purporting to identify a high error rate (approximately 80% of claims) among inpatient rehabilitation hospital admissions in a small sample of 220 claims. Based on its findings, the HHS-OIG extrapolated the error rate to the universe of inpatient rehabilitation claims and, among other things, recommended reevaluation of the IRF-PPS. However, the HHS-OIG report involves an extremely small sample size, is not a random sample of cases, includes incorrect references to coverage requirement regulations, appears to conflate technical documentation requirements with medical necessity determinations, and is at odds with actual MAC reviews of claims during that same timeframe which found substantially lower error rates. Notwithstanding the technical statistical flaws that can arise in sampling small groups of claims and the extremely problematic nature of extrapolation in the context of individualized decisions of medical judgment as some courts have noted, sampling and extrapolation pose a growing risk to healthcare providers in the form of more significant claims of overpayments and increased legal costs to defend against these problematic regulatory practices. In a recent federal court case, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of CMS and affirmed the application of extrapolation errors identified in a sample of claims to support larger claims for overpayment. As discussed under \"Reimbursement Risks” above, we are currently challenging, among other things, the use of extrapolation in a 2017 UPIC audit. Any associated loss of revenue or increased legal costs could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.", "Efforts to comply with regulatory mandates to increase the use of electronic health data and health system interoperability may lead to enforcement and negative publicity which could adversely affect our business.", "For many years, a primary focus of the healthcare industry has been to increase the use of electronic health records, or “EHR,” and", "the sharing of the health data among providers, payors and other members of the industry. The federal government has been a significant driver of that initiative through rules and regulations. In 2009, as part of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act, the federal government set aside $27 billion of incentives for acute-care hospitals and other providers, not including IRFs, to adopt EHR systems. In 2020, CMS and HHS’s Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (“ONC”) finalized policy changes implementing interoperability, information blocking, and patient access provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act and supporting the MyHealthEData initiative, designed to allow patients to access their health claims information electronically through the application of their choosing. The companion rules will transform the way in which healthcare providers, health information technology developers, health information exchanges/health information networks (“HIEs/HINs”), and health plans share patient information. For example, the ONC rule prohibits healthcare providers, health IT developers, and HIEs/HINs from engaging in practices that are likely to interfere with, prevent, materially discourage, or otherwise inhibit the access, exchange or use of electronic health information, also known as “information blocking.” The ONC rule also requires regulated actors to respond to requests for electronic health information in the content and manner requested, with some exceptions. Enforcement of ONC’s and CMS’ new health information access, exchange, and use standards promulgated in the 2020 rules began in 2021, and noncompliance can result in civil monetary penalties, exclusion from participation in federal health care programs and other appropriate “disincentives” that have not yet been identified by the agencies. The HHS-OCR patient right of access initiative, which began in late 2019 and has similar objectives to the new ONC initiative, such as promoting and enforcing patient access to health information, has led to dozens of settlements of enforcement actions.", "The goals of increased use of electronic health data and interoperability are improved quality of care and lower healthcare costs", "generally. However, increased use of electronic health data and interoperability inherently magnifies the risk of security breaches involving that data and information systems used to share it, which risk is discussed under “Other Operational Risks” below. Additionally, interoperability and the sharing of health information have received increasingly negative publicity. There is at least one well publicized instance where organizations received significant negative publicity for sharing health data despite having appeared to comply in all respects with privacy law. There can be no assurance that our efforts to improve the care we deliver and to comply with the law through increasing use of electronic data and system interoperability will not receive negative publicity that may materially and adversely affect our ability to get patient referrals or enter into joint ventures with other providers or may lead to greater regulatory scrutiny. Negative publicity may also lead to federal or state regulation that conflicts with current federal policy and interferes with the healthcare industry’s efforts to improve care and reduce costs through use of electronic data and interoperability.", "If any of our hospitals fail to comply with the Medicare enrollment requirements or conditions of participation, that hospital could be terminated from the Medicare program.", "Each of our hospitals must comply with extensive enrollment requirements and conditions of participation for the Medicare program. If any of our hospitals fail to meet any of the Medicare enrollment requirements or conditions of participation, we may receive a notice of deficiency from the applicable survey agency or contractor, as applicable. If that hospital then fails to institute an acceptable plan of correction and correct the deficiency within the applicable correction period, it could lose the ability to bill Medicare. A hospital could be terminated from the Medicare program if it fails to address the deficiency within the applicable correction period. If CMS terminates one hospital, it may increase its scrutiny of others under common control. From time to time, we have individual hospitals that receive notices of deficiency. To date, we have addressed those as they have arisen, and we have not experienced a termination.", "On September 5, 2019, CMS released a final rule that will implement over a period of time additional provider enrollment provisions", "and create several new revocation and denial authorities in an attempt to bolster CMS’ efforts to prevent waste, fraud and abuse. A few provisions of this new rule could significantly increase the complexity of filing enrollment applications for all of our provider entities, including increased burden related to tracking and identifying required reporting data from our joint venture partners. This rule requires Medicare and Medicaid providers and suppliers to disclose any current or previous (in the last five years), direct or indirect affiliation with a provider or supplier that has ever had a disclosable event. A disclosable event is any uncollected debt to Medicare or Medicaid, payment suspension under a federal health care program, denial, revocation or termination of enrollment (even if it is under appeal), or exclusion by the HHS-OIG from participation in a federal health care program. The rule also broadens the definition of an affiliation, including many indirect ownership or control situations such as ownership interests in a publicly traded company. If CMS determines an affiliation with a disclosable event poses an undue risk of fraud, waste or abuse, then the provider reporting that affiliation may be subject to exclusion from Medicare. Currently, information regarding uncollected debt, payment suspensions and enrollment actions are not generally", "available, so obtaining such information on affiliates could prove difficult or impossible in some situations. CMS intends to issue further guidance on the level of effort it expects providers to undertake to uncover information on their affiliates.", "Under this new rule, CMS may revoke a provider’s Medicare enrollment, including all of the provider’s locations, if the provider", "bills for services performed at, or items furnished from, one location that it knew or should have known did not comply with Medicare enrollment requirements, including making the disclosures discussed above. CMS has the ability to prevent applicants from enrolling in the program for up to three years if a provider is found to have submitted false or misleading information in its initial enrollment application. Additionally, CMS can now block providers and suppliers who are revoked from re-entering the Medicare program for up to 10 years. CMS may also revoke a provider’s enrollment if it fails to report on a timely basis any change in ownership or control, revocation or suspension of a federal or state license or certification, or any other change in its enrollment data.", "Any termination of one or more of our hospitals from the Medicare program for failure to satisfy the enrollment requirements or", "conditions of participation could materially adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.", "If we are found to have violated applicable privacy and security laws and regulations or our contractual obligations, we could be subject to sanctions, fines, damages and other civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities, harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operation and liquidity.", "There are a number of federal and state laws, rules and regulations, as well as contractual obligations, relating to the protection,", "collection, storage, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of confidential, sensitive and personal information, including certain patient health information, such as patient records.

Existing laws and regulations are constantly evolving, and new laws and regulations that apply to our business are being enacted at every level of government in the United States. In many cases, these laws and regulations apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our affiliates and other parties with whom we conduct business.

The HIPAA privacy and security regulations protect medical records and other personal health information by limiting their use and disclosure, giving individuals the right to access, amend, and seek accounting of their own health information, and limiting most uses and disclosures of health information to the minimum amount reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. The HITECH Act strengthened HIPAA enforcement provisions and authorized state attorneys general to bring civil actions for HIPAA violations. It also permits HHS to conduct audits of HIPAA compliance and impose significant civil monetary penalties even if we did not know and could not reasonably have known about a violation. If we are found to have violated the HIPAA privacy or security regulations or other federal or state laws protecting the confidentiality of patient health or personal information, including but not limited to the HITECH Act, we could be subject to litigation, sanctions, fines, damages and other civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities, harm our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.", "Numerous other federal and state laws protect the confidentiality, privacy, availability, integrity and security of PHI.

We also expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions. The U.S. Congress has considered, but not yet passed, several comprehensive federal data privacy bills over the past few years, such as the CONSENT Act, which was intended to be similar to the landmark 2018 European Union General Data Protection Regulation.

The future of many aspects of healthcare regulation generally and Medicare reimbursement specifically remains uncertain.

We believe we have the necessary capabilities — change agility, strategic relationships, quality of patient outcomes, cost effectiveness, and ability to capitalize on growth opportunities — to adapt to and succeed in a dynamic, highly regulated industry, and we have a proven track record of doing so.", "As we continue to execute our business plan, the following are some of the key challenges we face.", "•       Operating in a Highly Regulated Industry. We are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local government levels. More specifically, because Medicare comprises a significant portion of our Net operating revenues, failure to comply with the laws and regulations governing the Medicare program and related matters, including anti-kickback and anti-fraud requirements, could materially and adversely affect us. These rules and regulations have affected, or could in the future affect, our business activities by having an impact on the reimbursement we receive for services provided or the costs of compliance, mandating new documentation standards, requiring additional licensure or certification, regulating our relationships with physicians and other referral sources, regulating the use of our properties, and limiting our ability to enter new markets or add new capacity to existing hospitals. Ensuring continuous compliance with extensive laws and regulations is an operating requirement for all healthcare providers. See Item 1, Business, “Regulation” and Item 1A, Risk Factors, “Reimbursement Risks” and “Other Regulatory Risks” for detailed discussions of the most important regulations we face and our programs intended to ensure we comply with those regulations.", "Reimbursement claims made by healthcare providers, including inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, are subject to audit from time to time by governmental payors, such as Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and state Medicaid programs, their agents, such as the Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MACs”) that act as fiscal intermediaries for all Medicare billings, other auditors contracted by CMS, and private insurance carriers, as well as the United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General. These audits as well as the ordinary course claim reviews of our billings result in payment denials, including recoupment of previously paid claims from current accounts receivable. Healthcare providers can challenge any denials through an administrative appeals process that can be extremely lengthy, taking several years. For additional details of these claim reviews, See Item 1, Business, “Sources of Revenues,” Item 1A, Risk Factors, “Reimbursement Risks,” and Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, “Net Operating Revenues” and “Accounts Receivable,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.", "•       Changes in Medicare Reimbursement and Regulatory Requirements for Operating IRFs. Substantially all of our business consists of inpatient rehabilitation services. From a payor perspective, our reimbursement and regulatory risk is concentrated in the Medicare inpatient rehabilitation rules and regulations. We derive approximately 65% of our Net operating revenues from fee-for-service Medicare.", "As part of its annual rulemaking process for various healthcare provider categories, CMS adopts IRF reimbursement rate changes effective from October through the following September. On July 27, 2022, CMS released its notice of final rulemaking for fiscal year 2023 for IRFs (the “2023 IRF Rule”) under the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system (the “IRF-PPS”). Based on our analysis that utilizes, among other things, the acuity of our patients annualized over a twelve-month period ended June 30, 2022, our experience with outlier payments over this same time frame, and other factors, we believe the 2023 IRF Rule will result in a net increase to our Medicare payment rates of approximately 4.0% effective October 1, 2022.", " Congress also regularly adopts legislation that directly affects Medicare reimbursement. These reimbursement changes can result in limitations on the increases in and, in some cases, significant roll-backs or reductions in the levels of payments for IRF services. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”) enacted in 2010 provides for specific reductions to healthcare providers’ annual reimbursement rate updates and other payment policy changes. The Budget Control Act of 2011 provides for an automatic 2% reduction, or “sequestration,” of Medicare program payments for all healthcare providers. Sequestration took effect April 1, 2013 and, as a result of subsequent legislation, will continue through mid-year 2032 unless Congress and the President take further action. In response to the public health emergency associated with the pandemic, Congress and the President suspended sequestration through March 31, 2022. Additional Medicare payment reductions are also possible under the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (“Statutory PAYGO”). Statutory PAYGO requires, among other things, that mandatory spending and revenue legislation not increase the federal budget deficit over a 5- or 10-year period. There can be no assurance that future federal rulemaking and legislation will not result in reimbursement freezes or reductions, or reimbursement increases that are less than the increases we experience in our costs of operation.", "In addition to direct changes to Medicare reimbursement rates, other federal regulatory and legislative actions affect healthcare generally and our business specifically. For example, the ACA also included provisions intended to promote alternative payment models, such as accountable care organizations (“ACOs”) and bundled payment initiatives, including the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Initiative Advanced (“BPCI Advanced”) and the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (“CJR”) program. Likewise, CMS regulatory proposals can affect our operations. On December 14, 2020, CMS announced a five-year review choice demonstration for inpatient rehabilitation services (the “IRF RCD”). The IRF RCD would affect the process in which we submit, and receive reimbursement for, Medicare claims. A number of key details on this demonstration have yet to be released, and it is not clear how or when CMS will implement this demonstration.", "For additional discussion of changes to Medicare reimbursement, including the 2023 IRF Rule and Statutory PAYGO, and other proposed and adopted legislative and regulatory actions, including alternative payment models and the IRF RCD, that may be material to our business, see Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, “Reimbursement Risks” and “Other Regulatory", "Concerns held by federal policymakers about the federal deficit, national debt levels, and the solvency of the Medicare trust fund, as well as other healthcare policy priorities, could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions, further entitlement reform legislation affecting the Medicare program, and further reductions to provider payments. We cannot predict what, if any, changes in Medicare spending or modifications to the healthcare laws and regulations will result from future budget or other legislative or regulatory initiatives.", "As discussed in Item 1, Business, healthcare will almost certainly be the subject of significant regulatory and legislative changes regardless of party in control of the executive and legislative branches of state and federal governments. We will continue to evaluate these laws and regulations and position the Company for this industry shift. Based on our track record, we believe we can adapt to these regulatory and industry changes. Further, we have engaged, and will continue to engage, actively in discussions with key legislators and regulators to attempt to ensure any healthcare laws or regulations adopted or amended promote our goal of high-quality, cost-effective care.", "•       Maintaining Strong Volume Growth. Various factors, including competition and increasing regulatory and administrative burdens, may impact our ability to maintain and grow our hospital volumes. In any particular market, we may encounter competition from local or national entities with longer operating histories or other competitive advantages, such as acute-care hospitals who provide post-acute services similar to ours or other post-acute providers with relationships with referring acutecare hospitals or physicians. Aggressive payment review practices by Medicare contractors, aggressive enforcement of regulatory policies by government agencies, and restrictive or burdensome rules, regulations or statutes governing admissions practices may lead us to not accept patients who would be appropriate for and would benefit from the services we provide. In addition, from time to time, we must get regulatory approval to expand our services and locations in states with certificate of need laws. This approval may be withheld or take longer than expected. In the case of new-store volume growth, the addition of hospitals to our portfolio also may be difficult and take longer than expected. Clinical staffing shortages, recently exacerbated by the pandemic, can also limit our ability to admit patients in a given market.", "•       Recruiting and Retaining High-Quality Personnel. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for a discussion of competition for staffing, shortages of qualified personnel, and other factors that may increase our labor costs and constrain our ability to take new patients. Recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, including management, for our inpatient hospitals remain a high priority for us. We attempt to maintain a comprehensive compensation and benefits package that allows us to remain competitive in this challenging staffing environment while remaining consistent with our goal of being a high-quality, cost-effective provider of post-acute services. Additionally, our operations have been affected and may in the future be affected by staffing shortages where employees must self-quarantine due to exposure to an infectious disease, where employees are unavailable due to a lack of childcare or care for elderly family, or where competition creates a nursing shortage in a given market. These factors have resulted in increased labor costs, including significant sign-on and shift bonuses, and increased use of contract labor as discussed in the “Results of Operations” section of this Item.", "We remain confident in the prospects of our business based on the increasing demands for the services we provide to an aging", "population.

In calculating the leverage ratio under our credit agreement, we are permitted to use pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, the calculation of which includes historical income statement items and pro forma adjustments, subject to certain limitations, resulting from (1) dispositions and repayments or incurrence of debt and (2) investments, acquisitions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and other operational changes to the extent such items or effects are not yet reflected in our trailing four-quarter financial statements. Our interest coverage ratio is defined in our credit agreement as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense, excluding the amortization of financing fees, for the trailing four quarters. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum leverage ratio requirement per our credit agreement was 4.75x and the minimum interest coverage ratio requirement was 3.0x, and we were in compliance with these covenants. Based on Adjusted EBITDA for 2022 and the interest rate in effect under our credit agreement during the three-month period ended December 31, 2022, if we had drawn on the first day and maintained the maximum amount of outstanding draws under our revolving credit facility for the entire year, we would still be in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio requirements.", "On December 9, 2021, we announced the commencement of a consent solicitation of holders of our 5.75% Senior Notes due 2025,", "4.50% Senior Notes due 2028 (the “2028 Notes”), 4.75% Senior Notes due 2030 (the “2030 Notes”), and 4.625% Senior Notes due 2031 (the", "“2031 Notes” and collectively the “Notes”) for the adoption of certain amendments to an indenture (the “Base Indenture”) dated as of December 1, 2009, as supplemented by each Notes’ respective supplemental indenture (together with the Base Indenture, the “Indenture”), which provided us with greater flexibility in effecting the Spin Off discussed in the “Executive Overview” section of this Item.

Management’s estimate of the transaction price includes estimates of price concessions for such items as contractual allowances, potential adjustments that may arise from payment and other reviews, and uncollectible amounts. Revenues recognized are subject to a number of elements which impact both the overall amount of revenue realized as well as the timing of the collection of the related patient accounts receivable. Factors considered by management in determining the estimated transaction price include the patient’s total length of stay for in-house patients, each patient’s discharge destination, the proportion of patients with secondary insurance coverage and the level of reimbursement under that secondary coverage, and the amount of charges that will be disallowed by payors. Management assumes these factors will remain consistent with the experience for patients discharged in similar time periods for the same payor classes. The Company’s consolidated accounts receivable balance is $610.1 million as of December 31, 2022. Management estimates the allowance for uncollectible amounts based on the aging of accounts receivable, historical collection experience for each type of payor, and other relevant factors.

These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of patient accounts receivable related to contractual allowances and uncollectible amounts, which included controls over management’s process, assumptions, and data used to estimate contractual allowances and uncollectible amounts and determine patient accounts receivable. These procedures also included, among others, i) evaluating management’s process for developing the estimate for contractual allowances and uncollectible amounts, ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the model, iii) evaluating the historical accuracy of management’s process for developing the estimate of the amount which will ultimately be collected by comparing actual cash collections to the previously recorded patient accounts receivable, and iv) developing an independent expectation of the amount expected to be collected by management. Developing an independent expectation involved calculating the percentage of cash collections as compared to the recorded patient accounts receivable balance for prior years and comparing that percentage to management’s collection expectation used to determine the current year estimate for contractual allowances and uncollectible amounts.", "As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s Medicare claims have been subject to review by Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MACs”) under various programs such as “widespread probes” and the Targeted Probe and Educate initiative.

In addition, laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex, subject to interpretation, and are routinely modified for provider reimbursement. All healthcare providers participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements. Federal regulations require submission of annual cost reports covering medical costs and expenses associated with the services provided under each hospital provider number to program beneficiaries. Annual cost reports required under the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to routine audits, which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to Encompass Health under these reimbursement programs.

We dispute, or “appeal,” most of these denials. As discussed above, our historical experience and success in the adjudication of these appeals is a component of our estimate of transaction price. The Medicare appeals adjudication process is administered by the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals (“OMHA”) and has been subject to significant delay resulting in a backlog of claims awaiting adjudication. Beginning in March 2020, OMHA increased the frequency of hearings and the number of claims set at each hearing, which we believe adds to the substantive and procedural deficiencies in the appeals process. During 2022, the backlog of “widespread probe” claims adjudicated by the administrative law judge (“ALJ”) continued and were substantially completed. This OMHA practice resulted in a reduction in our success in the adjudication of these appeals, but have increased the pace of recovery of these claims. We have appealed certain adverse ALJ rulings to the Department Appeals Boards (“DAB”), the final level of administrative review. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $52 million in claims are awaiting review at the DAB. In addition, we have appealed approximately $6 million in claims denied by the DAB to several United States District Courts, all of which are pending review as of December 31, 2022.", "In August 2017, CMS announced the Targeted Probe and Educate (“TPE”) initiative. Under the TPE initiative, MACs use data", "analysis to identify healthcare providers with high claim error rates and items and services that have high national error rates. Once a MAC selects a provider for claims review, the initial volume of claims review is limited to 20 to 40 claims. The TPE initiative includes up to three rounds of claims review if necessary with corresponding provider education and a subsequent period to allow for improvement. If results do not improve sufficiently after three rounds, the MAC may refer the provider to CMS for further action, which may include extrapolation of error rates to a broader universe of claims or referral to a UPIC or RAC (defined below). We cannot predict the impact of the TPE initiative on our ability to collect claims on a timely basis.", "In connection with CMS approved and announced Recovery Audit Contractors (“RACs”) audits related to inpatient rehabilitation", "facilities (“IRFs”), we received requests from 2013 to 2022 to review certain patient files for discharges occurring from 2010 to 2022. These RAC audits are focused on identifying Medicare claims that may contain improper payments. RAC contractors must have CMS approval before conducting these focused reviews which cover issues ranging from billing documentation to medical necessity. Medical necessity is an assessment by an independent physician of a patient’s ability to tolerate and benefit from intensive multi-disciplinary therapy provided in an IRF setting.", "CMS has also established Unified Program Integrity Contractors (“UPICs”), previously known as Zone Program Integrity Contractors. These contractors perform fraud, waste, and abuse detection, deterrence and prevention activities for Medicare and Medicaid claims. Like the RACs, the UPICs conduct audits and have the ability to refer matters to the HHS-OIG or the DOJ. Unlike RACs, however, UPICs do not receive a specific financial incentive based on the amount of the error as a result of UPIC audits. We have, from time to time, received UPIC record requests which have resulted in claim denials on paid claims. We have appealed substantially all UPIC denials arising from these audits using the same process we follow for appealing other denials by contractors. In December 2017, we received notice of a", "UPIC audit at one of our hospitals. The UPIC sampled 100 claims and challenged the propriety of a subset of the sample representing $1.3 million in previously paid claims. The UPIC extrapolated the alleged error rate to all claims from that hospital during a period of approximately four years, resulting in an alleged overpayment of $33.9 million. Our MAC later reduced the determination of overpayment to", "$30.5 million, which it collected through recoupment of current claims during 2019. We appealed the overpayment determination to an", "Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”), who heard the appeal in August 2021. In October 2022, the ALJ", "overturned $12.5 million of the overpayment determination. We received payment of this amount, plus $3.2 million in interest, in December 2022. We have appealed the remaining $18.0 million of the overpayment determination to the DAB, the next level of administrative appeal, challenging both the denials and the improper use of extrapolation. It is not possible to predict when this matter will be resolved or the ultimate outcome.", "To date, the Medicare claims that are subject to these post-payment audit requests represent less than 1% of our Medicare patient", "discharges from 2010 to 2022. Because we have confidence in the medical judgment of both the referring and admitting physicians who assess the treatment needs of their patients, we have appealed substantially all claim denials arising from these audits using the same process we follow for appealing denials by MACs. Due to the delays announced by CMS in the related adjudication process discussed above, we believe the resolution of any claims that are subsequently denied as a result of these claim audits could take several years. In addition, because we have limited experience with UPICs and RACs in the context of claims reviews of this nature, we cannot provide assurance as to the timing or outcomes of these disputes. As such, we make estimates for these claims based on our historical experience and success rates in the claims adjudication process, which is the same process we follow for denials by MACs.
