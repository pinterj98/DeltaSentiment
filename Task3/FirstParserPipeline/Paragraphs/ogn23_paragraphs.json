In December 2021, we also signed a supplemental license with Merck that provides a limited expansion of the fields in which it may use the underlying technology of Nexplanon / Implanon NXT beyond contraception in exchange for milestone payments.", "While the expiration of a product patent normally results in a loss of market exclusivity for the covered pharmaceutical product, commercial benefits may continue to be derived from, for example: (i) later-granted patents on processes and intermediates related to the most economical method of manufacture of the active ingredient of such product; (ii) patents relating to the use or delivery of such product; and (iii) patents relating to novel compositions and formulations. In addition, in the United States and certain other countries, an additional period of market or data exclusivity that may be available under relevant law. For example, Nexplanon may be eligible for an additional three years of market exclusivity on the five-year efficacy indication in the United States from the of FDA approval of this indication. The effect of product patent expiration on pharmaceutical products also depends upon many other factors, such as the nature of the market and the position of the product in it, the growth of the market, the complexities and economics of the process for manufacture of the active ingredient of the product and the requirements of new drug provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or similar laws and regulations in other countries.", "Additions to market or data exclusivity are sought in the United States and other countries through all relevant laws, including laws increasing patent life. Some of the benefits of increases in patent life have been partially offset by an increase in the number of incentives for and use of generic products. Additionally, improvements in intellectual property laws are sought in the United States and other countries through reform of patent and other relevant laws and implementation of international treaties.", "For further information with respect to our patents, see the sections entitled \"Risk Factors\" and Note 20 \"Contingencies—Patent Litigation\" to the Financial Statements included in this report.", "Worldwide, all of our important products are sold under trademarks that are considered in the aggregate to be of material importance. Trademark protection continues in some countries as long as used; in other countries, as long as registered.

We also incurred royalty expenses totaling $6 million in 2023 under patent and know-how licenses we hold.", "We are subject to a significant number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally, many of which place restrictions on our ability to transfer, access and use personal data across our business. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there are privacy and data protection frameworks with the potential to directly affect our business. These include, for instance, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), which went into effect in May 2018 and imposes penalties of up to 4% of global revenue, and China's Personal Information Protection Law (\"PIPL\"), which came into effect November 1, 2021. The data protection regulatory environment in China has been evolving quickly, including regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data (CBDT). These laws regulate the processing of personal information and increase the obligations of companies to protect and safeguard information. Certain of these regulations also require organizations to evaluate cross-border transfers of personal information and may require localization of certain data if specific conditions are met.", "Additional laws and regulations continue to be adopted in various jurisdictions. These include: the California Consumer Privacy Act, the", "California Privacy Rights Act, Virginia's Consumer Data Protection Act, Colorado's Privacy Act, and the United Arab Emirates' Protection of Personal Data Protection. These changing requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices or compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business.", "We conduct our business in highly competitive markets which mirror the equally competitive pharmaceutical industry. Our competitors include other worldwide research-based pharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug manufacturers. Our operations may be adversely affected by generic and biosimilar competition as our products mature, as well as technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, the generic availability of competitors' branded products and new information from clinical trials of marketed products or postmarketing surveillance. In addition, patent rights are increasingly being challenged by competitors and the outcome can be highly uncertain. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products and could result in the payment of royalties or in the recognition of an impairment charge with respect to intangible assets associated with certain products. Competitive pressures continue to intensify as the industry grows.", "To remain competitive, the additional resources required to meet market challenges include quality control, flexibility to meet buyer specifications, an efficient distribution system and a strong technical information service. We plan to continue to acquire and market products through external alliances, such as licensing arrangements and collaborations, and have designed our sales and marketing efforts to address changing industry conditions.", "In the United States private sector, consolidation and integration among health care providers is a major factor in the competitive pharmaceutical products marketplace. Private third-party insurers, as well as federal and state governments, employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. In addition to formulary tier co-pay or co-insurance differentials, private health insurance companies and self-insured employers have been raising co-payments and co-insurance required from beneficiaries, particularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products. Private health insurance companies are also increasingly imposing utilization management tools, such as clinical protocols requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine. These management tools are also used in treatment areas in which the payor has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. As the United States payor market further concentrates, and as more drugs become available in generic form, pharmaceutical companies may face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payors. In addition, other proposals that allow international reference pricing or, under certain conditions, the international importation of medicines, may be considered.", "We face increasing pricing pressure globally from managed care organizations and government agencies and programs. This pricing pressure could negatively affect our sales and profit margins. In the United States, these concerns include: (i) practices of managed care organizations, federal and state exchanges and institutional and governmental purchasers, and (ii) federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid.", "In the United States, we are impacted by expanded Medicaid rebates, Medicaid-managed care utilization, and increases in the types of entities eligible for the federal 340B drug discount program. These programs require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay a percentage of the negotiated price of the medicine, including biosimilar products, when Medicare Part D beneficiaries are in the Medicare Part D coverage gap (i.e., the so-called \"donut hole provision\") until January 1, 2025. Pharmaceutical manufacturers must pay a percentage of the negotiated price of branded pharmaceuticals, biologics and biosimilar products, when Medicare Part D beneficiaries are in the initial coverage phase, and another percentage of the negotiated price in the catastrophic phase of Medicare Part D coverage. Increases in these percentages or changes in the timing of their implementation could increase our cost-sharing responsibility for any approved product. We recorded approximately $15 million, $16 million and $17 million revenue reduction in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This reduction was related to the coverage gap or \"donut hole\" provision. We recorded approximately $3 million, $3 million and $10 million of costs within selling, general and administrative expenses in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for the annual health care reform fee. In the future, our drugs could be subject to a higher Medicaid rebate liability.", "We may also be affected by developments relating to the federal 340B drug discount program. In June 2023, we implemented a policy to reduce diversion and inappropriate claims for discounts and rebates by contract pharmacies that were affiliated with 340B-eligible entities. Multiple manufacturers have adopted similar policies, and the Department of Health and Human Services has sent several of these manufacturers letters claiming that the policies violate the 340B statute and referring the manufacturers for potential enforcement action. Certain drug manufacturers challenged these letters in federal court. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit recently ruled in favor of several manufacturers. To date, other challenges are still pending. We believe that our policy complies with the 340B statute. At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing. European Union", "Pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products are not harmonized at the EU level, but rather controlled by individual EU Member States. These Member States have attempted to contain drug costs by engaging in reference pricing. Reference pricing allows authorities to examine pre-determined markets for published prices of drugs. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has intensified. As a result, manufacturers are erecting increasingly high entry barriers to new products. Additionally, EU Member States have the power to restrict the range of pharmaceutical products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some EU Member States, we may be required to conduct studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other therapies that are considered the local standard of care. There can be no assurance that any EU Member State will allow favorable pricing, reimbursement and market access conditions for any of our products, or that it will be feasible to conduct additional cost-effectiveness studies, if required.", "In Japan, the pharmaceutical industry is subject to government-mandated biennial price reductions of pharmaceutical products. Furthermore, the government can order re-pricings for specific products if it determines that use of such products will exceed certain thresholds defined under applicable re-pricing rules.", "Our business in China has grown rapidly in the past few years, and the importance of China to our overall pharmaceutical business has increased accordingly. Continued growth of our business in China depends upon ongoing development of a favorable environment for innovative pharmaceutical products, sustained access for our current in-line products, and the absence of trade impediments or adverse pricing controls. In recent years, the Chinese government has introduced and implemented several structural reforms to accelerate the shift to innovative products and reduce costs. The Chinese government updated the National Reimbursement Drug List (\"NRDL\") for the governmentadministered insurance plans; however, every two years regular access to the NRDL is coupled with significant price reductions and price reviews for NRDL products.", "While pricing pressure has always existed in China, health care reform has increased this pressure in part due to the acceleration of generic substitution through volume-based procurement (\"VBP\"). The Chinese VBP program operates through a tendering process for mature products that have generic substitutes with a Generic Quality Consistency Evaluation (\"GQCE\") approval. Mature products that have entered into the first nine rounds of VBP have had, on average, a price reduction of over 50%. VBP", "has been a roughly semi-annual process that will have a significant impact on mature products moving forward, which we expect to increase pricing pressure on our products in China. There are 374 molecules currently included under VBP, and it is expected that an aggregate of 500 molecules will be subject to VBP by 2025. After the expiration of the national VBP period, individual provinces may implement their own provincial-level VBP programs. In addition, multiple Chinese provinces are piloting a Universal Reimbursement Payment Standard (\"URPS\") program in their respective provinces. Under the URPS, the government may determine the reimbursement prices by referring to the prices of the lowest-priced VBP winning products, with any remaining costs then passed along to the patients in the form of a co-pay, which reduces the affordability of certain products with prices that exceed the lowest-priced VBP-winning products. The URPS policy will create additional pricing and volume pressure for pharmaceutical products that are subject to the program and may adversely affect our business and results of operations.", "In July 2023, the Chinese government began an industry-wide anti-corruption campaign that increased scrutiny on the health care industry. The campaign caused disruptions to academic activities across the health care industry, which negatively affected our business in late 2023. We believe that the health care industry will continue to be subject to increasing scrutiny in the China market.", "Governments in many other markets are also focused on constraining health care costs and have enacted price controls and measures impacting intellectual property, including in exceptional cases, threats of compulsory licenses that aim to put pressure on the price of innovative pharmaceuticals or result in constrained market access to innovative medicine. We anticipate that pricing pressures and market access challenges will continue in the future to varying degrees in such markets.", "In addressing cost containment pressures, we engage in public policy advocacy with policymakers and continues to work to demonstrate that our medicines provide value to patients and to those who pay for health care. We advocate with government policymakers to encourage a longterm approach to sustainable health care financing that ensures access to innovative medicines and does not disproportionately target pharmaceuticals as a source of budget savings. In markets with historically low rates of health care spending, we encourage those governments to increase their investments and adopt market reforms to improve their citizens' access to appropriate health care, including medicines.", "The pharmaceutical and medical device industries are also subject to regulation by regional, country, state and local authorities around the world, focused on standards and processes for determining drug and device safety and effectiveness, as well as conditions for sale or reimbursement. In the United States, the FDA administers requirements covering the testing, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling and marketing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices.", "The EU has also adopted directives and other legislation concerning the classification, approval for marketing, labeling, advertising, manufacturing, wholesale distribution, integrity of the supply chain, pharmacovigilance and safety monitoring of medicinal products for human use. These provide mandatory standards throughout the EU, which may be supplemented or implemented with additional regulations by the EU Member States.", "Industry practice and government regulations in the United States and most foreign countries provide for the determination of effectiveness and safety of new chemical compounds suitable for pharmaceutical use through pre-clinical tests and controlled clinical evaluation. Before a new drug may be marketed in the United States, recorded data on pre-clinical and clinical investigations are included in the NDA for a drug or the Biologics License Application (\"BLA\") for a biologic, and submitted to the FDA for the required approval, which can be a phased process. As a manufacturer and distributor of drug products, our activities are regulated under various federal and state statutes and state manufacturer and wholesaler laws. Manufacturers and distributors of controlled substances must also maintain registration with the Drug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\"), and comply with various regulatory requirements, including maintaining records and inventory, reporting to the DEA, and meeting certain security and operational safeguards. Similar requirements exist in most states.", "The FDA imposes medical device regulations that govern requirements for design, development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, clinical trials, and pre-market clearance and approval, among other requirements. Marketed devices are also subject to ongoing FDA regulation. Requirements include those related to establishment registration and device listing, labeling and advertising, unique device identification, and good manufacturing practices.

We currently market Jada outside of the United States in a number of international markets and is subject to the regulatory requirements imposed in those jurisdictions. In the future, we also plan to continue to sell our medical devices in additional major international markets and will be subject to the regulatory requirements imposed in those jurisdictions. For example, in order to sell medical devices in EU member countries, we will need to comply with the MDR. Foreign sales outside the EU (including in the UK) are subject to the foreign government regulations of the relevant jurisdiction, and we will need to obtain approval or marketing authorization by the appropriate regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing activities in those countries.", "We cannot market our pharmaceutical products or medical devices or new indications or modifications to our existing products unless and until we have obtained all required regulatory approvals or marketing authorizations in each relevant jurisdiction. Our applications or submissions for regulatory approval or marketing authorization may be rejected or otherwise delayed by the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities. For example, the FDA may issue complete response letters indicating that our applications for our pharmaceutical products are not ready for approval. Once obtained, we must maintain approval or marketing authorization as long as we plan to market products in each jurisdiction where approval or marketing authorization is required. The FDA or other regulators may change their policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions, which may prevent or delay regulatory approval or marketing authorization of our future products or impact our ability to modify our currently marketed products on a timely basis. Our failure to obtain approval or marketing authorization, significant delays in the approval or marketing authorization process or our failure to maintain approval or marketing authorization in any jurisdiction will prevent us from selling the products in that jurisdiction. We would not be able to realize revenues for our pharmaceutical products or medical devices in any jurisdiction where we do not have required approval or marketing authorization.", "We or our partners may fail to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of any of our pharmaceutical product candidates or medical devices in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, which would prevent or delay development, regulatory approval or marketing authorization and commercialization of our product candidates.", "Before obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities for the sale of our pharmaceutical product candidates, we must demonstrate through pre-clinical studies and clinical trials that our product candidates are both safe and effective for use in each target indication and population. Obtaining marketing authorization for our devices may also require pre-clinical and clinical trials. Pre-clinical and clinical trials are difficult to design and implement, and can take many years to complete, and their ultimate outcome is uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the pre-clinical study and clinical trial processes. Accordingly, there is a high risk of failure and we may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval or marketing authorization of our product candidates.", "We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent receipt of regulatory approval or marketing authorization, or our ability to commercialize our product candidates, including for example, issues with study execution including timely access to study drugs; inability to recruit and enroll study subjects; failure of our product candidates in pre-clinical studies or clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy; receipt of feedback from the FDA or other regulatory authorities that require us to modify the design of our clinical trials; and negative or inconclusive clinical trial results that may require us to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon certain research and/or development programs.", "We may be required to conduct additional pre-clinical studies, clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, or we may be unable to successfully complete pre-clinical studies or clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing in a timely manner. If the results of these studies, trials or tests are not positive (or are only modestly positive), or if there are safety concerns, we may incur unplanned costs, as well as delays in our efforts to obtain regulatory approval or marketing authorization. Even if we receive such approval, we may be more limited or restrictive than anticipated, or be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements.", "Developments following regulatory approval or marketing authorization may adversely affect sales of our pharmaceutical products or medical devices.", "Even after a pharmaceutical product or medical device reaches the market, we continue to be subject to significant post-marketing regulatory requirements and oversight. The regulatory approvals or marketing authorizations that we may receive for our pharmaceutical products and medical devices will require the submission of reports to regulatory authorities and on-going surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of our products, may contain significant limitations related to use restrictions for specified groups, warnings, precautions or contraindications, and may include burdensome post-approval study or risk management requirements. In addition, even after a pharmaceutical product or device has obtained marketing authorization or clearance, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event and device malfunction reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, import, export, recalls and recordkeeping for our products will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements, and we will be subject to periodic inspections. Failure to comply with any of these requirements could subject us to a variety of formal or informal enforcement actions by the FDA or other regulators, result in a recall or market withdrawal of our products, require us to cease manufacturing and distribution of the products, trigger product liability or other litigation, or otherwise impact our ability to realize revenues for our products. As previously disclosed, we voluntarily initiated market actions, including recalls, in certain markets with respect to our suspension injections Diprospan, Celestone, ChronodoseTM 1 (betamethasone), and Celestone Soluspan® (betamethasone) related to a non-conforming component of a manufacturing line at our Heist, Belgium plant. We do not believe this development will materially impact us. It is possible that future recalls or similar developments could materially and adversely impact our business, result of operations, and financial condition.", "Likewise, if previously unknown side effects, adverse events, malfunctions or other quality or safety concerns are discovered or if there is an increase in negative publicity regarding known side effects of any of our products, it could significantly reduce demand for the product or require us to take actions that could negatively affect sales, including initiating corrections of a marketed product or removing the product from the market, restricting our distribution of the product or applying for marketing authorization for labeling changes. The FDA could also require us to conduct post-marketing studies of our products. Further, we are at risk for product liability and consumer protection claims and civil and criminal governmental actions related to our products, research and marketing activities. In addition, dissemination of promotional materials through evolving digital channels serves to increase visibility and scrutiny in the marketplace.", "Certain developments may decrease demand for our products, including the following:", "•       negative results in post-approval Phase 4 trials or other studies;", "•       review by regulatory authorities or other expert bodies of our products that are already marketed based on new data or other developments in the field;", "•       the recall, loss or modification of regulatory approval or marketing authorization of products that are already marketed; and", "•       changing government regulations regarding safety, efficacy, quality or labeling.", "Issues with product quality could have an adverse effect on our business or cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products, among other negative consequences.", "Our success also depends on our ability to maintain and routinely improve product quality and our quality management program. Quality management plays an essential role in meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, improving our products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products. While we have a quality system that covers the lifecycle of our products, quality and safety issues have and may in the future occur with respect to our products. A quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports, voluntary or official action indicated, warning letters, import bans, product recalls (either voluntary or required by FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries) or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions (which may include corporate integrity agreements), costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity or a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products.", "Certain of our products currently benefit from patent protection and market exclusivity. When the patent protection and market exclusivity periods for such products expire, a significant and rapid loss of sales from those products is generally experienced. Expiry of patent protection and market exclusivity for products that contribute significantly to our sales will adversely affect our business.", "We depend upon patents to provide us with exclusive marketing rights for certain of our products for some period of time. Loss of patent protection typically leads to a significant and rapid loss of sales for that product where lower priced generic versions of that drug or other competitors become available. In the case of current or future products that contribute significantly to our sales, a loss of market exclusivity could materially adversely affect our business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. We expect market exclusivity for Nexplanon in the United States to expire in 2027, and market exclusivity for the majority of countries where Nexplanon is commercialized outside the United States will expire in 2025. See \"Business—Products and \"—Intellectual Property\" for details, including the patent protection for certain of our marketed products.", "We depend on our patent rights for the marketing of certain of our products, and invalidation or circumvention of our patent rights would adversely affect our business.", "Patent protections are important to the marketing of certain of our products, particularly certain of our women's health products in the United States and in most major non-U.S. markets. Patents covering products that we have introduced normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the successful marketing and sale of certain of our products.", "Even if we succeed in obtaining patents covering our products, third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications. It is important for our business to successfully defend the patent rights that provide market exclusivity for our products. We are involved in patent disputes relating to challenges to our patents or claims by third parties of infringement against their patents. We defend our patents both within and outside the United States, including by filing claims of infringement against other parties. In particular, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products from time to time file abbreviated new drug applications with the FDA seeking to market generic forms of our products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by it. Patent litigation and other challenges to our patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive us of market exclusivity for a patented product or, in some cases, thirdparty patents may prevent us from marketing and selling a product in a particular geographic area, negatively affecting our business and results of operations.", "Additionally, certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies or in other circumstances, which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions and negatively affect our business and results of operations. Further, court decisions relating to other companies' patents, potential legislation in both the United States and certain foreign markets relating to patents, as well as regulatory initiatives, may result in a more general weakening of intellectual property protection.", "If one or more of our important products lose patent protection in profitable markets, sales of those products are likely to decline significantly as a result of generic versions of those products becoming available. Our results of operations may be adversely affected by the lost sales unless and until we have launched commercially successful products that replace the lost sales. In addition, if products with intangible assets that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with acquisitions experience difficulties in the market that negatively affect product cash flows, we may recognize material non-cash impairment charges with respect to the value of those products.", "We have incurred substantial indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.", "At December 31, 2023, we had outstanding indebtedness of approximately $8.8 billion, as described more fully in the Notes to our financial statements. In addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance acquisitions or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents that govern our indebtedness. Current or future levels of indebtedness may increase the possibility that we will be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay amounts due in respect of such indebtedness.", "Our ability to issue additional debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for our products, if our customers or suppliers are unable to pay amounts due to us or there are other significantly unfavorable changes in economic conditions. Volatility in the world financial markets could increase borrowing costs or affect our ability to access the capital markets. These conditions may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain our credit ratings.", "We are subject to minimum purchase obligations under certain supply agreements, and if we fail to meet those minimum purchase requirements, our financial results may be unfavorably impacted.", "We are subject to minimum purchase obligations under certain supply agreements, which requires us to purchase minimum amounts of materials critical to our product manufacturing over specified time periods. If we fail to meet these minimum purchase requirements, we may still be required to pay for the cost of the minimum inventory purchases. If we are unable to offset these payments, it could result in a lower margin. During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized $5 million and $24 million, respectively, in Cost of Sales pertaining to estimated unavoidable losses associated with a long-term vendor supply contract conveyed as part of the spinoff. We are also aware of a limited number of other arrangements that have similar provisions which could result in these types of payments. We do not currently expect these payments to be material; however, in the aggregate they may become material if additional amounts are identified in the future, and they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.", "The health care industry in the United States has been, and will continue to be, subject to increasing regulation and political action.", "We believe that the health care industry will continue to be subject to increasing regulation and political and legal action at both the federal and state levels in the United States and internationally, and it is uncertain how this will affect our business.", "Changes to the health care system enacted as part of health care reform in the United States, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid and private sector beneficiaries, could result in further pricing pressures. As an example, health care reform has contributed to an increase in the number of patients in the Medicaid program under which sales of pharmaceutical products are subject to substantial rebates. There are pending legal and legislative developments relating to the 340B drug pricing program, including ongoing litigation challenging federal enforcement actions against manufacturers and recently introduced and enacted state legislation.", "We cannot predict the likelihood of additional future changes in the health care industry in general, the pharmaceutical industry in particular, or what impact they may have on our business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.", "We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, and we may face serious consequences for violations if we fail to meet the applicable legal and regulatory requirements.", "We are currently subject to a number of government laws and regulations and, in the future, could become subject to new government laws and regulations. The costs of compliance with such laws and regulations, or the negative results of non-compliance, could adversely affect our business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. The costs of compliance and penalties for non-compliance may be particularly significant with respect to health care reform initiatives in the United States or in other countries, including additional mandatory discounts or fees; new laws, regulations and judicial or other governmental decisions affecting pricing, reimbursement, and market access or marketing within or across jurisdictions; new and increasing data privacy regulations and enforcement, particularly in the EU, the UK, the United States, and China; legislative mandates or preferences for local manufacturing of medical products; emerging and new global regulatory requirements for reporting payments and other value transfers to health care professionals and health care organizations; environmental regulations; and emerging and new regulations on human rights and environmental matters in the supply chain and importation restrictions, embargoes, trade sanctions and legislative or other regulatory changes. We will also be subject to and are monitoring the passage through the legislative process of the proposed draft directive and regulation intending to reform EU pharmaceutical legislation, (generally known as the \"EU Pharma Package\"), which is intended to promote innovation and competitiveness through a simplified regulatory framework, provide access to innovative and affordable medicines to patients, recognize innovation with effective incentives, address shortages and supply security, and provide enhanced protection for the environment. We are still evaluating the potential impacts of the EU Pharma Package on our business.", "Because of our U.S. and international operations, we are also subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, in the United States and internationally, including but not limited to U.S. domestic bribery laws, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the \"FCPA\"), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and other applicable anti-bribery and corruption laws. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, contractors and other third-party collaborators from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting and/or receiving, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything else of value to or from foreign officials or other persons in the public or private sector. The FCPA also requires U.S. public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Recent years have seen substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our operations outside the United States could increase the risk of", "such violations. Our business is also heavily regulated and involves significant interaction with foreign officials. In many countries outside the U.S., prescribers of our products are employed by government entities, and purchasers are themselves government entities. As such, our interactions with such prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA, as well as other similar under anti-corruption laws and/or regulations enacted by other countries. The failure to comply with the FCPA and similar such laws could result in civil or criminal sanctions or other adverse consequences.", "In addition to selling our products internationally, we currently engage third parties outside the United States, and may engage additional third parties outside the United States, to sell our products internationally and to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations and other regulatory approvals.

In addition, our operations and performance may be affected by political or civil unrest or military action. As a result of global economic conditions, some parties may delay or be unable to satisfy their payment or reimbursement obligations. In addition, patients' ability to afford health care may also be affected by job losses or other economic hardships, increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, and lost health care insurance coverage. Further, with rising international trade tensions or sanctions, our business may be adversely affected following new or increased tariffs, as well as increased costs of materials, products, and commodities upon which we rely.

Data protection authorities from the different EU Member States may still enforce the GDPR differently, reflecting variations that arise under national-level regulations and guidelines (e.g., labor laws, processing of national identification numbers), which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU. Guidance at both EU level and at the national level in individual EU Member States concerning implementation and compliance practices is often updated or otherwise revised, resulting in a challenging regulatory environment.", "There is, moreover, a growing trend towards required public disclosure of clinical trial data in the EU, which adds to the complexity of obligations relating to processing health data from clinical trials. Failing to comply with these obligations could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, harm to our reputation, and adversely impact our business and operating results. The uncertainty regarding the interplay between different regulatory frameworks further adds to the complexity that we face with regard to data protection regulation.", "Additional laws and regulations enacted in the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America have increased enforcement and litigation activity in the United States and other developed markets, as well as increased regulatory cooperation among privacy authorities globally. The data protection regulatory environment in China has been evolving quickly, including regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data (CBDT). These laws, including the PIPL, regulate the processing of personal information and increase obligations on companies to protect and safeguard information.

Reliance on third parties and their systems poses risks, including that the third parties will not comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements for activities conducted on our behalf or for our benefit. This could lead to penalties that flow to us, require us to undertake costly corrective measures such as recalling product, interrupt our business plans such as by rendering clinical data not usable for regulatory submissions, or other adverse consequences on our business. We may also learn of certain issues after entering into an agreement that were not identified during diligence and may impact the ability to realize the projected business goals of the agreement.

Additional potential effects of climate change to our business could include increased operating costs due to additional regulatory requirements, changes in supply and suppliers due to regulatory requirements, water limitations and disruptions to our supply chain. For example, concern over climate change continues to result in new legal or regulatory requirements designed to mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment, such as the EU's CSRD, California's Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and Climate Related Financial Risk Act, and similar regulations under consideration by the SEC. Some potential risks are integrated into our business planning, including investment in reducing energy, water use and greenhouse gas emissions.

In addition, Merck would recognize a taxable gain to the extent that the fair market value of our Common Stock exceeds Merck's tax basis in such stock on the date of the spinoff. Each of Merck and Organon generally will be responsible for any tax-related losses imposed on Merck or Organon, respectively, as a result of the failure of a transaction to qualify for tax-free treatment, to the extent that the failure to so qualify is attributable to actions, events or transactions relating to Merck's or Organon's respective stock, assets or business, or a breach of the relevant covenants made by Merck or Organon in the tax matters agreement.

In addition, we are required to indemnify Merck against any tax liabilities as a result of such actions, even if we did not participate in or otherwise facilitate such actions. In the event the spinoff fails to be tax-free as a result of such actions, our indemnity obligation for Merck's tax liability under the tax matters agreement would be substantial and could materially affect our cash flow.

If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows of these assets, or appropriate asset groupings, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset's fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, we estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows approach.", "Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment as of October 1 each year, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that fair value is less than carrying value. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macroeconomic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows, and overall financial performance. If we conclude it is more likely than not that fair value is less than carrying value, a quantitative fair value test is performed. If carrying value is greater than fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the difference (up to the carrying value of goodwill). We completed the annual qualitative goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2023 and concluded that there was no impairment to goodwill as the fair value of the reporting unit was significantly in excess of the carrying value.", "Acquired intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value, assigned an estimated useful life, and amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. When events or circumstances warrant a review, we will assess recoverability from future operations using pretax undiscounted cash flows derived from the lowest appropriate asset groupings. Potential risks leading to impairment could include loss of exclusivity occurring earlier than expected, competition, pricing reductions, and other macroeconomic changes. Impairments are recognized in operating results to the extent that the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, which is determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows. We did not have impairment charges as of December 31, 2023. We recorded impairment charges of $9 million and $7 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively.

Adverse changes in assumptions utilized in our inventory reserve calculations could result in an increase to our inventory valuation reserves and higher cost of sales.", "Business combinations are evaluated in order to determine whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses. We make certain judgments, which include assessment of the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities. If we determine that substantially all of the fair value of gross assets included in a transaction is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), we account for the transaction as an asset acquisition. In an asset acquisition, acquired IPR&D with no alternative future use is charged to expense and contingent consideration is not recognized at the acquisition date. Product development milestones are recognized upon achievement and sales-based milestones are recognized when the milestone is deemed probable of being achieved.", "To be considered a business, the assets in a transaction need to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. Businesses acquired are consolidated upon obtaining control. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at the date of acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies are generally recognized at fair value. If fair value cannot be determined, the asset or liability is recognized if probable and reasonably estimable; if these criteria are not met, no asset or liability is recognized.

The Company acts as the principal in its customer arrangements and therefore records revenue on a gross basis. The majority of the Company's contracts have a single performance obligation — the promise to transfer goods. Shipping is considered immaterial in the context of the overall customer arrangement and damages or loss of goods in transit are rare. Therefore, shipping is not deemed a separately recognized performance obligation.", "Revenues from sales of products, including tenders, are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which the Company has determined is when title and risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the customer and the Company is entitled to payment.", "The nature of the Company's business gives rise to several types of variable consideration including discounts and returns, which are estimated at the time of sale generally using the expected value method, although the most likely amount method is used for prompt pay discounts.", "In the United States, sales discounts are issued to customers at the point-of-sale, through an intermediary wholesaler (known as chargebacks), or in the form of rebates. Additionally, sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions.

In addition, revenues are recorded net of time value of money discounts if collection of accounts receivable is expected to be in excess of one year.", "Chargebacks are discounts that occur when a contracted customer purchases through an intermediary wholesaler. The contracted customer generally purchases product from the wholesaler at its contracted price plus a mark-up. The wholesaler, in turn, charges the Company back for the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contract price paid to the wholesaler by the customer. The Company estimates the provision for chargebacks based on expected sell-through levels by the Company's wholesale customers to contracted customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels. Rebates are amounts owed based upon definitive contractual agreements or legal requirements with private sector, (Managed Care), and public sector (Medicaid and Medicare Part D) benefit providers, after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant. The provision for rebates is based on expected patient usage, as well as inventory levels in the distribution channel to determine the contractual obligation to the benefit providers. The Company uses historical customer segment utilization mix, sales, changes to product mix and price, inventory levels in the distribution channel, government pricing calculations and prior payment history to estimate the expected provision.", "The Company continually monitors the provision for aggregate customer discounts.

The accrued balances relative to the provision for chargebacks and rebates, based on the terms and nature of the rebate, are included in Accounts receivable and Accrued and other current liabilities. Rebates may also be required based on specific product sales thresholds. The Company applies an estimated factor against its actual invoiced sales to represent the expected level of future discount or rebate obligations associated with the sale. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the accrued balances related to the provision for rebates and discounts included in other current liabilities were approximately $126 million and $109 million, respectively.", "The Company maintains a returns policy that allows customers in certain countries to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date (generally, three to six months before and 12 months after product expiration).

Goodwill is evaluated for impairment as of October 1 each year, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that fair value is less than carrying value. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that fair value is less than carrying value, a quantitative fair value test is performed. If carrying value is greater than fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the difference (up to the carrying value of goodwill). The Company completed the annual qualitative goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2023 and concluded that there was no impairment to goodwill as the fair value of the reporting unit was significantly in excess of the carrying value.", "Acquired Intangibles — Acquired intangibles include products and product rights and licenses, which are initially recorded at fair value, assigned an estimated useful life, and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The Company's intangibles also include the products and product rights intangible assets attributed to Organon from Merck. The intangible assets attributable to the Company's operations have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements based on Merck's historical cost. Licenses include milestone payments made to collaborative partners upon or subsequent to regulatory approval. The estimated useful lives of acquired intangibles range from 5 to 15 years. The Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of its acquired intangibles may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows of these assets, or appropriate asset groupings, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the carrying value of the intangible asset and its fair value, which is determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows. See Note 13 \"Intangibles\" for additional details.", "Acquired In-Process Research and Development (\"IPR&D\") — IPR&D that the Company acquires in conjunction with the acquisition of a business represents the fair value assigned to incomplete research projects which, at the time of acquisition, have not reached technological feasibility. The amounts are capitalized and are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects. Upon successful completion of each project, Organon will make a determination as to the thenuseful life of the intangible asset, generally determined by the period in which the substantial majority of the cash flows are expected to be generated, and begin amortization. The Company evaluates IPR&D for impairment as of October 1 each year, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, by performing a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the IPR&D intangible asset with its carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized in operating results.

The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recorded in the foreign currency translation account, which is included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and reflected as a separate component of equity. For those operations that operate in highly inflationary economies and for those operations where the U.S. dollar has been determined to be the functional currency, non-monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated using historical rates, while monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current rates, with the U.S. dollar effects of rate changes included in Exchange losses.", "Organon calculates foreign currency translation on its consolidated assets and liabilities. For periods prior to the Separation, these consolidated financial statements include Merck's foreign currency translation for the Organon Entities.", "Stock-Based Compensation — Prior to the Separation, certain of the Company's employees historically participated in Merck's stock-based compensation plans. Stock-based compensation expense was either allocated to the Company based on a proportionate cost allocation method or recorded based on specific identification. Effective June 3, 2021, Organon established the 2021 Incentive Stock Plan (the \"Plan\"). A total of 35 million shares of Common Stock are authorized under the Plan. The plan provides for the grant of various types of awards, including restricted stock unit awards, stock appreciation rights, stock options, performance-based awards and cash awards. Under the Plan, the exercise price of awards, if any, is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share on that date. The Company measures stock-based compensation for equity awards at fair value on the date of grant and records stock-based compensation as a charge to earnings net of the estimated impact of forfeited awards. Accordingly, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation cost only for those stock-based awards that are estimated to ultimately vest over their requisite service period, based on the vesting provisions of the individual grants. The cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated forfeiture rate is recognized as compensation cost in earnings in the period of the change. See Note 7 \"Stock-Based Compensation Plans\" for additional details.", " Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans — Prior to the Separation, the defined benefit plans in which the Company participated related primarily to plans sponsored by Merck and for which other businesses of Merck also participate (\"Shared Plans\"). The Company accounted for the Shared Plans as multiemployer plans and therefore the related assets and liabilities were not reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For such periods prior to Separation, the Consolidated Statement of Income reflects a proportional allocation of net periodic benefit cost for the Shared Plans associated with the Company. For certain defined benefit plans attributable to the Organon Entities, the over funded or underfunded status of the plan was recognized as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company's participation in the defined pension and postretirement benefit plans sponsored by Merck concluded upon the completion of the Separation on June 2, 2021. At Separation, Organon became the plan sponsor for certain non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans.

The Company's operations were included in the tax returns of certain Organon Entities, Transferring Entities or the respective Merck entities of which the Company's business was a part.", "Deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting based on enacted tax laws and rates. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. The Company assesses all available evidence to estimate whether a valuation allowance should be recorded against existing deferred tax assets. The amounts of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted in future periods if estimates of future income are reduced or increased.", "The Company evaluates tax positions to determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position.

The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. When evaluating contracts for embedded leases, the Company exercises judgment to determine if there is an explicit or implicit identified asset in the contract and if the Company controls the use of that asset. Embedded leases are immaterial. The lease term includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company has made an accounting policy election not to record short-term leases (leases with an initial term of 12 months or less) on the balance sheet. Lease expense associated with short term leases is not material for all periods presented.", "Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Since most of the Company's leases do not have a readily determinable implicit discount rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of lease payments. On a quarterly basis, an updated incremental borrowing rate is determined based on the weighted average remaining lease term of each asset class and the Company's pretax cost of debt for that same term. The updated rates for each asset class are applied prospectively to new leases. The Company does not separate lease components (e.g. payments for rent) from non-lease components (e.g. common-area maintenance costs) in the event that the agreement contains both.

In applying these models, the Company used both historical data and current market data to estimate the fair value of its options. The Black-Scholes model assumptions include expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, volatility, and term of the options.

Pursuant to the show cause order, in March 2014, the Femur Fracture MDL court dismissed with prejudice approximately 650 cases on preemption grounds. Plaintiffs in approximately 515 of those cases appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (\"Third Circuit\"). In March 2017, the Third Circuit issued a decision reversing the Femur Fracture MDL court's preemption ruling and remanding the appealed cases back to the Femur Fracture MDL court. In May 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the Third Circuit had incorrectly concluded that the issue of preemption should be resolved by a jury, and accordingly vacated the judgment of the Third Circuit and remanded the proceedings back to the Third Circuit to address the issue in a manner consistent with the Supreme Court's opinion. In November 2019, the Third Circuit remanded the cases back to the District Court in order to allow that court to determine in the first instance whether the plaintiffs' state law claims are preempted by federal law under the standards described by the Supreme Court in its opinion.

Subject to certain exceptions specified in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Organon assumed liability for all pending and threatened legal matters related to products transferred from Merck to Organon in connection with the spinoff, including competition investigations resulting from enforcement activity concerning Merck's conduct involving Organon's products. Organon could be obligated to indemnify Merck for fines or penalties, or a portion thereof, resulting from such investigations.

Organon intends to vigorously defend its patents, which it believes are valid, against infringement by companies attempting to market products prior to the expiration of such patents. As with any litigation, there can be no assurance of the outcomes, which, if adverse, could result in significantly shortened periods of exclusivity for these products, potential payment of damages and legal fees, and, with respect to products acquired through acquisitions, potentially significant intangible asset impairment charges.", "In June 2017, Microspherix LLC (\"Microspherix\") sued Organon in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey asserting that the manufacturing, use, sale and importation of Nexplanon infringed several of Microspherix's patents that claim radio-opaque, implantable drug delivery devices. Microspherix claimed damages from September 2014 until the patents expired in May 2021. Organon brought Inter Partes Review proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"USPTO\") and successfully stayed the district court action. The USPTO invalidated some, but not all, of the claims asserted against Organon. Organon appealed the decisions that found claims valid, and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the USPTO's decisions. A claim construction hearing was held on March 2, 2022, and a claim construction order issued on February 27, 2023. This case was scheduled for trial before a jury in Camden, New Jersey starting on October 16, 2023. On October 13, 2023, the parties informed the district court that an agreement in principle of the key terms of a settlement was reached. In December 2023, the parties executed the settlement agreement and the district court dismissed the case. Organon reserved $80 million to cover the settlement in 2023.", "In addition to the matters described above, there are various other pending legal proceedings involving Organon, principally product liability and intellectual property lawsuits. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such proceedings, in the opinion of Organon as of December 31, 2023, either the likelihood of loss is remote or any reasonably possible loss associated with the resolution of such proceedings is not expected to be material to Organon's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows either individually or in the aggregate.", "Legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. Some of the significant factors considered in the review of these legal defense reserves are as follows: the actual costs incurred by Organon; the development of Organon's legal defense strategy and structure in light of the scope of its litigation; the number of cases being brought against Organon; and the costs and outcomes of completed trials and the most current information regarding anticipated timing, progression, and related costs of pre-trial activities and trials in the associated litigation. The legal defense reserve as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $20 million and $17 million, respectively, and represented Organon's best estimate of the minimum amount of defense costs to be incurred in connection with its outstanding litigation; however, events such as additional trials and other events that could arise in the course of its litigation could affect the ultimate amount of legal defense costs to be incurred by Organon. Organon will continue to monitor its legal defense costs and review the adequacy of the associated reserves and may determine to increase the reserves at any time in the future if, based upon the factors set forth, it believes it would be appropriate to do so.", "In management's opinion, the liabilities for all environmental matters that are probable and reasonably estimable have been accrued and totaled $19 million and $20 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
