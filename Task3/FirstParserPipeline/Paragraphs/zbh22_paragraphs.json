The process of obtaining FDA clearance or approval to market a product is resource intensive, lengthy, and costly. FDA review may involve substantial delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products.  Most of our new products fall into a classification that requires the submission of a Premarket Notification (510(k)) to the FDA before we can market the new device.  This process requires us to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as, that is, substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device. Other devices we develop and market require stringent FDA clinical investigation and Premarket Approval (“PMA”) requirements, including submission of clinical and laboratory data that establishes that the new medical device is safe and effective.  Additionally, certain of our new products incorporate innovations related to artificial intelligence, machine learning and software as a medical device, which are subject to emerging FDA oversight and regulation.  ", "We are subject to FDA Quality System regulations governing design and manufacturing practices, testing, manufacturing quality assurance, labeling and record keeping and reporting requirements for our products, which apply both to our own and to our third-party manufacturers' operations.  We are required to establish a quality system by which we monitor our (and our third-party manufacturers') manufacturing processes and maintain records that show compliance with FDA regulations and manufacturers' written specifications and procedures.", "There are also requirements of state and local governments with which we must comply in the manufacture and marketing of our products.", "The FDA conducts announced and unannounced periodic and on-going inspections of medical device manufacturers to determine compliance with its Quality System, and other applicable, regulations.  If in connection with these inspections the FDA believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures, it may issue inspectional observations on Form FDA483 (“Form 483”) that would necessitate prompt corrective action.  If FDA inspectional observations are not addressed and/or corrective action is not taken in a timely manner and to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA may issue a warning letter (which would similarly necessitate prompt corrective action) and/or proceed directly to other forms of enforcement action, including the imposition of operating restrictions, including ceasing operations on one or more facilities, enjoining and restraining legal violations pertaining to products, seizing products, negotiating the entry of a consent decree and permanent injunction against us, recommending prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”), and assessing civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees or us. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively manufacturing, marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  For information regarding a warning letter and certain Form 483 inspectional observations that we are addressing at a single Zimmer Biomet site, see Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements.", "The FDA, in cooperation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), administers controls over the import of medical devices into the U.S. and can prevent the importation of products the FDA deems to violate the FDCA or its implementing regulations.

that the fair value is below its carrying amount.  We evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  Significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets and riskadjusted discount rates.

test in the fourth quarter of 2022, we determined our EMEA reporting unit's carrying value was in excess of its estimated fair value.  Fair value was determined using income and market approaches.  Fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit.  Fair value under the market approach utilized the guideline public company methodology, which uses valuation indicators determined from other businesses that are similar to our EMEA reporting unit.  As a result of its carrying value being in excess of its estimated fair value, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $289.8 million.  No goodwill balance remains for the EMEA reporting unit.", "See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion and the factors that contributed to this impairment charge.", "We have three other reporting units with goodwill assigned to them.  For two of these reporting units, their estimated

the other reporting unit and concluded it was more likely than not the fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.      ", "Future impairment in our reporting units could occur if the estimates used in the income and market approaches change.  If our estimates of profitability in the reporting unit decline, the fair value estimate under the income approach will decline.  Additionally, changes in the broader economic environment could cause changes to our estimated discount rates and comparable company valuation indicators, which may impact our estimated fair values.

activities.  Our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments be the same as hedged forecasted transactions.  On this basis, with respect to cash flow hedges, changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments.  As part of our risk management program, we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue, operating results, cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates.  A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2022 indicated that, if the U.S. Dollar uniformly strengthened or weakened in value by 10 percent relative to all currencies, with no change in the interest differentials, the fair value of those contracts would affect earnings in a range of a decrease of approximately $93 million to an increase of approximately $88 million before income taxes in periods through June 2025.", "Any change in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction.  Consequently, foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate

We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended.  Capitalized software costs generally include external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software and compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software project.  Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line or weighted average estimated user basis when the software is ready for its intended use over the estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate three to fifteen years.  ", "For cloud computing arrangements that are considered a service contract, our capitalization of implementation costs is aligned with the internal use software requirements.  However, on our consolidated balance sheet these implementation costs are recognized in other noncurrent assets.  On our consolidated statement of cash flows, these implementations costs are recognized in operating cash flows.  The implementation costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the related service contract.          ", "Instruments - Instruments are hand-held devices used by surgeons during total joint replacement and other surgical procedures.  Instruments are recognized as long-lived assets and are included in property, plant and equipment.  Undeployed instruments are carried at cost or net realizable value.  Instruments that have been deployed to be used in surgeries are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on average estimated useful lives, determined principally in reference to associated product life cycles, primarily five years.  We review instruments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an instrument may not be recoverable.  Depreciation of instruments is recognized as SG&A expense.", "Goodwill - Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests.  Goodwill has been assigned to reporting units.  Potential impairment of a reporting unit is identified by either comparing a reporting unit’s estimated fair value to its carrying amount or doing a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit’s fair value from the last quantitative assessment to determine if there is potential impairment.  We may do a qualitative assessment when the results of the previous quantitative test indicated the reporting unit’s estimated fair value was significantly in excess of the carrying value of its net assets and we do not believe there have been significant changes in the ", "reporting unit’s operations that would significantly decrease its estimated fair value.  If a quantitative assessment is performed, the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of goodwill are determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and/or use of a market approach by looking at market values of comparable companies.  Significant assumptions are incorporated into our discounted cash flow analyses such as forecasted net sales, revenue growth rates, forecasted operating expenses and risk-adjusted discount rates.  We perform this test in the fourth quarter of the year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not below its carrying amount.  If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded in the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value. See Note 11 for more information regarding goodwill.", "Intangible Assets - Intangible assets are initially measured at their fair value.  We have determined the fair value of our intangible assets either by the fair value of the consideration exchanged for the intangible asset or the estimated after-tax discounted cash flows expected to be generated from the intangible asset.  Intangible assets with a finite life, including technology, certain trademarks and trade names, customer-related intangibles, intellectual property rights and patents and licenses are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life or contractual life, which may range from less than one year to twenty years.  Intangible assets with a finite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  ", "Intangible assets with an indefinite life, including certain trademarks and trade names and in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) projects, are not amortized.  Indefinite life intangible assets are assessed annually to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite life.  Intangible assets with an indefinite life are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not below its carrying amount.  An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.  The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be determined based upon the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value.  The fair values of indefinite lived intangible assets are determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis using the relief from royalty method or a qualitative assessment may be performed for any changes to the asset’s fair value from the last quantitative assessment.  The relief from royalty method estimates the cost savings associated with owning, rather than licensing, assets.  Significant assumptions are incorporated into these discounted cash flow analyses such as estimated growth rates, royalty rates and risk-adjusted discount rates.  We may do a qualitative assessment when the results of the previous quantitative test indicated that the asset’s fair value was significantly in excess of its carrying value.  ", "In determining the useful lives of intangible assets, we consider the expected use of the assets and the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, anticipated technological advances, changes in surgical techniques, market influences and other economic factors.  For technology-based intangible assets, we consider the expected life cycles of products, absent unforeseen technological advances, which incorporate the corresponding technology.  Trademarks and trade names that do not have a wasting characteristic (i.e., there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors which limit the useful life) are assigned an indefinite life.  Trademarks and trade names that are related to products expected to be phased out are assigned lives consistent with the period in which the products bearing each brand are expected to be sold.  For customer relationship intangible assets, we assign useful lives based upon historical levels of customer attrition.  Intellectual property rights are assigned useful lives that approximate the contractual life of any related patent or the period for which we maintain exclusivity over the intellectual property.  ", "Income Taxes - We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the new tax rate is enacted.", "We reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets.  In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations.  In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes.  ", "We operate on a global basis and are subject to numerous and complex tax laws and regulations.  The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations.  Our income tax filings are regularly under audit in multiple federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions.  Income tax audits may require an extended period of time to reach resolution and may result in significant income tax adjustments when interpretation of tax laws or allocation of company profits is disputed.  Because income tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant, we record tax positions based upon our estimates.  For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.  For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.", "Derivative Financial Instruments - We measure all derivative instruments at fair value and report them on our consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities.  We maintain written policies and procedures that permit, under appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization, the use of derivative financial instruments solely for risk management purposes.  The use of derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes is prohibited by our policy.  See Note 15 for more information regarding our derivative and hedging activities.

inventory into consignment, as we retain the ability to control the inventory.  Upon implantation, we issue an invoice and revenue is recognized.  Consignment sales represented approximately 85 percent of our net sales in 2022.  Pricing for products is generally predetermined by contracts with customers, agents acting on behalf of customer groups or by government regulatory bodies, depending on the market.  Price discounts under group purchasing contracts are generally linked to volume of implant purchases by customer healthcare institutions within a specified group.  At negotiated

faces.  We had previously taken goodwill impairment charges related to this reporting unit in prior years so when these negative macroeconomic factors occurred in 2022, the remaining goodwill was

The significant decline in our share price and that of most other publicly-traded companies resulted in us utilizing a higher risk-adjusted discount rate compared to the rate used in the previous annual goodwill impairment test to discount our future estimated cash flows to present value.
