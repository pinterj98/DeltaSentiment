Instruments are hand-held devices used by surgeons during total joint replacement and other surgical procedures.  Instruments are recognized as long-lived assets and are included in property, plant and equipment.  Undeployed instruments are carried at cost or net realizable value.  Instruments that have been deployed to be used in surgeries are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on average estimated useful lives, determined principally in reference to associated product life cycles, primarily five years.  We review instruments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an instrument may not be recoverable.  Depreciation of instruments is recognized as SG&A expense.", "Goodwill - Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests.  Goodwill has been assigned to reporting units.  Potential impairment of a reporting unit is identified by either comparing a reporting unit’s estimated fair value to its carrying amount or doing a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit’s fair value from the last quantitative assessment to determine if there is potential impairment.  We may do a qualitative assessment when the results of the previous quantitative test indicated the reporting unit’s estimated fair value was significantly in excess of the carrying value of its net assets and we do not believe there have been significant changes in the reporting unit’s operations that would significantly decrease its estimated fair value.  If a quantitative assessment is performed, the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of goodwill are determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and/or use of a market approach by looking at market values of comparable companies.  Significant assumptions are incorporated into our discounted cash flow analyses such as forecasted net sales, revenue growth rates, forecasted operating expenses and risk-adjusted discount rates.  We perform this test in the fourth quarter of the year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not below its carrying amount.  If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded in the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value. See Note 11 for more information regarding goodwill.", "Intangible Assets - Intangible assets are initially measured at their fair value.  We have determined the fair value of our intangible assets either by the fair value of the consideration exchanged for the intangible asset or the estimated after-tax discounted cash flows expected to be generated from the intangible asset.  Intangible assets with a finite life, including technology, certain trademarks and trade names, customer-related intangibles, intellectual property rights and patents and licenses are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life or contractual life, which may range from less than one year to twenty years.  Intangible assets with a finite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  ", "Intangible assets with an indefinite life, including certain trademarks and trade names and in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) projects, are not amortized.  Indefinite life intangible assets are assessed annually to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite life.  Intangible assets with an indefinite life are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not below its carrying amount.  An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.  The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be determined based upon the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value.  The fair values of indefinite lived intangible assets are determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis using the relief from royalty method or a qualitative assessment may be performed for any changes to the asset’s fair value from the last quantitative assessment.  The relief from royalty method estimates the cost savings associated with owning, rather than licensing, assets.  Significant assumptions are incorporated into these discounted cash flow analyses such as estimated growth rates, royalty rates and risk-adjusted discount rates.  We may do a qualitative assessment when the results of the previous quantitative test indicated that the asset’s fair value was significantly in excess of its carrying value.  ", "In determining the useful lives of intangible assets, we consider the expected use of the assets and the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, anticipated technological advances, changes in surgical techniques, market influences and other economic factors.  For technology-based intangible assets, we consider the expected life cycles of products, absent unforeseen technological advances, which incorporate the corresponding technology.  Trademarks and trade names that do not have a wasting characteristic (i.e., there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors which limit the useful life) are assigned an indefinite life.  Trademarks and trade names that are related to products expected to be phased out are assigned lives consistent with the period in which the products bearing each brand are expected to be sold.  For customer relationship intangible assets, we assign useful lives based upon historical levels of customer attrition.  Intellectual property rights are assigned useful lives that approximate the contractual life of any related patent or the period for which we maintain exclusivity over the intellectual property.  ", "Income Taxes - We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the new tax rate is enacted.", "We reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets.  In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations.  In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes.  ", "We operate on a global basis and are subject to numerous and complex tax laws and regulations.  The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions across our global operations.  Our income tax filings are regularly under audit in multiple federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions.  Income tax audits may require an extended period of time to reach resolution and may result in significant income tax adjustments when interpretation of tax laws or allocation of company profits is disputed.  Because income tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant, we record tax positions based upon our estimates.  For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.  For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.", "Derivative Financial Instruments -
