at the manager level.", "Abbott also has procedures and processes focused on ensuring employees receive equitable compensation, regardless of race or gender or other personal characteristics.", "The development, manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion, and distribution of Abbott’s products are subject to comprehensive government regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar international regulatory agencies.", "Government regulation by various international, supranational, federal and state agencies addresses (among other matters) the development and approval to market Abbott’s products, as well as the inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, supply chains, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-market surveillance, record keeping, storage, and disposal practices.", "In addition, Abbott’s clinical laboratories and associated testing services are subject to comprehensive government regulation, including registration, certification, and licensure, by federal, state, and local agencies, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and their respective foreign counterparts.", "Certain of these agencies require our clinical laboratories to meet quality assurance, quality control, and personnel standards and undergo inspections.", "During the COVID-19 public health emergency, many pandemic-related products (including diagnostic tests) were authorized by regulators for emergency use during the pandemic.", "In addition, many governments enacted policies to expedite or promote access to health care in order to slow or stop the spread of the virus.", "Examples included expansion of telehealth coverages and increased reimbursements for diagnostic testing.", "The U.S. federal public health emergency expired on May 11, 2023, which has not impacted the availability of the products authorized under the FDA’s Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA).", "Abbott is actively pursuing the FDA’s customary regulatory approval process for various COVID-19 diagnostic tests, because the FDA could revoke or terminate its EUAs.", "Abbott will continue to monitor further regulatory actions from relevant U.S. government agencies and assess potential impacts on pandemic-related government policies and product authorizations.", "Abbott’s international operations are also affected by trade and investment regulations in many countries.", "These may require local investment, restrict Abbott’s investments, or limit the import of raw materials and finished products.", "Abbott’s laboratory facilities, home monitoring services, and durable medical equipment suppliers, which provide services, related products and medical devices to consumers, are subject to additional laws and regulations applicable to health care providers and suppliers that submit claims for reimbursement to third-party payors.", "In the United States, Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party payors may from time to time conduct inquiries, claims audits, investigations, and enforcement actions relating to the claims or enrollment criteria.", "Abbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback, anti- self-referral, and false claims laws in the United States.", "Prescription drug, nutrition, and medical device manufacturers such as Abbott are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user, establishment, and other fees.", "Governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights.", "Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects Abbott’s business.", "Among other effects, health care regulations and significant changes thereto (such as the introduction of the Medical Devices Regulation and the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation in the European Union) substantially increase the time, difficulty, and costs incurred in developing, obtaining and maintaining approval to market, and marketing newly developed and existing products.", "Abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and investment to ensure compliance.", "Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product’s production and sale, suspension or revocation of billing privileges, and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties.", "Similarly, compliance with the laws and regulations governing clinical laboratories and testing services requires specialized expertise.", "Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in sanctions, including suspension, revocation, or limitation of a laboratory’s certification, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines or criminal penalties.", "Abbott’s business can also be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy, and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies, and others.", "These studies can call into question the utilization, safety, and efficacy of previously marketed products.", "In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use.", "Access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies, and private organizations in many countries.", "A major focus is cost containment.", "Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by health care payors and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures.", "Abbott expects that insurers and providers will continue attempts to reduce the cost or utilization of health care products.", "Many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing, or coverage limitations.", "Budgetary pressures on health care payors may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on Abbott’s products for the foreseeable future.", "In the United States, the federal government regularly evaluates reimbursement for medical devices, diagnostics, supplies, and other products, as well as the procedures in which these products may be used.", "The government follows a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system (PPS) for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home, and home health settings.", "DRG and PPS entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products.", "Other payment methodology changes have been proposed and implemented from time to time.", "For example, Medicare implemented a competitive bidding system for certain durable medical equipment (including diabetes products), enteral nutrition products, and supplies.", "Additionally, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act established a new payment system for clinical laboratory tests in 2018.", "Governmental cost containment efforts also affect Abbott’s nutritional products business.", "In the United States, for example, under regulations governing the federally funded Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, all states must have a cost containment program for infant formula.", "As a result, through competitive bidding states obtain rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program.", "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act) includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, and medical supplies covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure.", "In October 2018, the Substance Use Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act significantly expanded the types of healthcare providers for which reporting is required, beginning with reports filed in 2022.", "Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of governments worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals.", "Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties.", "Policy changes or implementation of new health care legislation could result in significant changes to health care systems.", "In the United States, this could include potential modification, including expansion or repeal of all or parts of the Affordable Care Act.", "The regulation of data privacy and security, and the protection of the confidentiality of certain personal information (including patient health information, financial information and other sensitive personal information), is increasing.", "For example, the European Union, China, various other countries, and various U.S. states (e.g., California, Virginia, and Colorado) have enacted or are considering enacting data protection laws that contain significant compliance obligations and financial penalties for noncompliance.", "In addition, regulators with general consumer protection authority, such as the Federal Trade Commission and U.S. states Attorneys General, are focused on how consumer data is used by entities in the health care industry.", "Further, there are regulations of data privacy and security that are specific to health care companies.", "For example, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued rules governing the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information, and the FDA has issued further guidance concerning cybersecurity for medical devices.", "In addition, certain countries have issued or are considering “data localization” laws, which limit companies’ ability to transfer protected data across country borders.", "Failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations can result in business disruption and enforcement actions, which could include civil or criminal penalties.", "Transferring and managing protected information will become more challenging as laws and regulations are enacted or amended, and Abbott expects there will be increasing complexity in this area.", "Abbott expects debate to continue at all government levels worldwide over the manufacture, quality assurance requirements, marketing authorization processes, post-market surveillance requirements, availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services, as well as data privacy and security.", "Abbott believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect the timing and expense associated with bringing health care products or services to market, access to health care products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or reimbursements or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, change health care delivery systems, create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceutical, nutrition, diagnostic, and medical device industries, or require additional reporting and disclosure.", "It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above.", "Copies of Abbott’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available, free of charge, through Abbott’s investor relations website (www.abbottinvestor.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after Abbott electronically

"Abbott’s corporate governance guidelines, outline of directorship qualifications, code of business conduct and the charters of Abbott’s audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and governance committee, and public policy committee are all available on Abbott’s investor relations website (www.abbottinvestor.com).", "In addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of Abbott’s securities.", "Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott, or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial, could also affect Abbott’s actual results.", "Abbott’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.", "Disruptions to Abbott’s global supply chain, which is large and complex, could negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations.", "Abbott’s operations and performance depend on its ability to manage its large and complex global supply chain.", "While Abbott has taken and will continue to take actions to mitigate the risks of disruptions to its global supply chain, disruptions to it could negatively affect Abbott's results of operations.", "For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and macroeconomic conditions such as inflationary pressures and labor shortages contributed to global supply chain challenges over the last few years, which adversely impacted the cost and availability of certain raw materials, supplies, and services.", "A discussion on the global supply chain
