participate in CORSIA.", "Nonetheless, we have voluntarily submitted verified emissions reports on our annual international emissions.", "While airlines had no offsetting obligations during the pilot phase of CORSIA as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on international travel, we expect that international airline emissions will likely exceed the new baseline during the next phase

the ETS.", "The scope of the ETS was narrowed so that it currently applies only to flights within the EEA through 2023 to align with the pilot phase of CORSIA.", "In 2023, the EU adopted new legislation extending this narrow scope of the EU ETS until 2027 but requires a review of CORSIA’s effectiveness in 2026, which could potentially lead to expansion of the EU ETS to include all flights departing the EU and EEA.", "As a result of the United Kingdom’s (\"UK\") withdrawal from the EU, UK flights are no longer part of the EU ETS and are instead regulated under a separate UK ETS

on fuel supplied at EU airports.", "The mandate requires that, of the jet fuel supplied in the EU, 2% must be SAF beginning in 2025, and the percentage increases incrementally over time to 70% in 2050.", "This mandate is expected to increase the cost of SAF in the EU.", "Additional regulation could result in taxation, regulatory or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the

by any such regulations.", "Certain airports have also adopted, and others could in the future adopt, GHG emission or climate-related goals and requirements that could impact our operations or require us to make changes or investments in our infrastructure.", "We are monitoring and evaluating the potential impact of such developments.", "Noise.", "The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990

restrictive or widespread.", "In addition, foreign governments may enact or allow airports to enact similar restrictions, which could adversely impact our international operations or require significant expenditures in order for our aircraft to comply with the restrictions.", "For example, in 2022, to reduce noise, the Netherlands announced a multi-phase plan to reduce the maximum number of flights authorized annually at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport.", "In 2023, airlines and airline associations, including Delta and KLM, challenged the initial phase of the plan.", "The legal challenge

a small amount of renewable fuels, it must purchase the majority of its RINs requirement in the secondary market.", "Market prices for RINs have been volatile and marked by periods of sharp increases

prohibiting the manufacture, sale, distribution and/or use of firefighting foam containing intentionally added PFAS.", "EPA’s proposed rule under CERCLA, once finalized, could subject airports, airlines, and refineries, among others, to potential liability for cleanup of historical PFAS contamination associated with use of PFAS-containing firefighting foam, and some state laws require

political developments in participating countries or the results of the initial phases of the program, the impact of CORSIA cannot be predicted at this time.", "However, CORSIA is expected to increase operating costs for airlines that operate internationally.", "In addition to CORSIA, we may face a patchwork of regulation of aircraft emissions in the U.S. and abroad and could become subject to further taxes, charges or additional requirements to obtain permits or purchase allowances or emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions in various jurisdictions.", "For example, in 2023, the EU adopted updated legislation on the EU Emissions Trading System (“ETS”).", "The new legislation continues in effect the so-called “stop-the-clock” provision whereby EU ETS does not apply to flights to or from locations outside the EEA, Switzerland or the UK until 2027.", "However, the legislation provides for a review of the effectiveness of CORSIA in 2026 that could, if CORSIA is not deemed sufficiently effective, lead to the application of EU ETS to all flights departing the EU and EEA.", "Also in 2023, the EU adopted legislation that will impose a SAF mandate on fuel supplied at EU airports.", "The mandate initially requires that, of the jet fuel supplied in the EU, 2% must be SAF beginning in 2025, and the percentage increases incrementally over time to 70% in 2050.", "This mandate is expected to increase the cost of SAF in the EU.", "Additional regulation could result in taxation, regulatory or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations

such regulations.", "While the specific nature of future actions is hard to predict, new laws or regulations related to environmental matters adopted in the U.S. or other countries could impose significant additional costs on or otherwise adversely affect our operations.", "Certain airports have also adopted, and others could in the future adopt, greenhouse gas emission or climate-related goals and requirements that could impact our operations or require us to make changes or investments in our infrastructure.", "In addition to risks from potential changes to environmental regulation and policy, the transition to lower-carbon technologies, such as SAF, or changes in consumer preferences resulting from a negative perception of the environmental impact of air travel could materially adversely affect our business and financial results.", "For example, lower-carbon technologies such as SAF and direct air capture technologies are currently not available at scale and may take decades to develop, and the cost to transition to them could be prohibitively expensive without appropriate government policies and incentives in place.", "As a result of the discretionary nature of air travel, the airline industry has been cyclical and particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions.", "Because we operate globally, our business is subject to economic and political conditions throughout the world.", "During periods of unfavorable or volatile economic conditions in the economy in the U.S. or abroad, demand for air travel can be significantly impacted as business and leisure travelers choose not to travel, seek alternative forms of transportation for short trips or conduct business using technological alternatives.", "If unfavorable economic conditions occur,

sources and market data.", "Additionally, we performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the changes to the Company’s net periodic benefit that would result from changes in the fair value measurement, compared the Company’s asset performance results to applicable third-party benchmarks, and assessed management’s historical accuracy of estimating fair value by performing retrospective review

Matter in Our Audit", "We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s accounting for its loyalty program, including controls over management’s review of the estimation of the mileage breakage and the completeness and accuracy of the data underlying the mileage breakage estimate.", "To test the estimate of breakage of mileage credits, our audit procedures included, among others, involving an actuarial specialist to assist in assessing the method used by the Company to develop the mileage breakage estimate and to independently develop a range of mileage breakage estimates and compare to the Company's estimate.", "Additionally, we tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying mileage data used to
