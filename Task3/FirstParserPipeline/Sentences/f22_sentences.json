emissions standards depends in part on the widespread availability of high-quality and consistent automotive fuels that the vehicles were designed to use.", "Legislative, regulatory, and judicial developments related to fuel quality at both the national and state levels could affect vehicle manufacturers’ warranty costs as well as their ability to comply with vehicle emissions standards.", "The California vehicle emissions program also includes requirements for manufacturers to produce and deliver for sale zero-emission vehicles (“ZEVs”).", "California’s light-duty vehicle ZEV regulation, which uses a system based on credits that can be banked and carried forward, mandates annual increases in the production and sale of battery-electric, fuel cell, and plug-in hybrid vehicles.", "For 2025 model year, this regulation will require approximately 22% of a manufacturer’s California light-duty vehicle sales volume be ZEVs.", "In August 2022, California approved a sweeping revision to the ZEV regulation.", "Beginning with the 2026 model year, the revised ZEV rule mandates a 35% ZEV sales requirement, rising to 100% by 2035.", "The revised regulation also imposes significant restrictions on credit usage, and new requirements for EV battery durability.", "California has also instituted ZEV regulations governing medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, beginning with the 2024 model year.", "These stringent ZEV requirements covering light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles could entail significant costs and compliance challenges, and include complex warranty

availability of adequate infrastructure to support vehicle charging.", "European Requirements.", "European Union (“EU”) and U.K. regulations, directives, and related legislation limit the amount of regulated pollutants that may be emitted by new motor vehicles and engines sold in the EU and the United Kingdom.", "Regulatory stringency has increased significantly with the application of Stage VI emission standards (first introduced in 2014) and the implementation of a laboratory test cycle for CO2 and emissions and the introduction of on-road emission testing using portable emission analyzers (Real Driving Emission or “RDE”).", "These on-road emission tests are in addition to the laboratory-based tests (first introduced in 2017).", "The divergence between the regulatory limit that is tested in laboratory conditions and the allowed values measured in RDE tests will ultimately be reduced to zero as the regulatory demands increase.", "In addition, new requirements for tailpipe and non-tailpipe emissions will be included in the upcoming Euro 7 regulation, and the lead-time for engineering and type approval may potentially be too short.", "The costs associated with complying with all of these requirements are significant, and following the EU Commission’s indication of its intent to accelerate emissions rules in its road map publication “EU Green Deal” as well as the EU sustainable mobility action plan, these challenges will continue in European markets, including the United Kingdom.", "In addition, the Whole Vehicle Type Approval (“WVTA”) regulation has been updated to increase the stringency of in-market surveillance.", "Moreover, following the U.K.’s withdrawal from the European Union, we may be subject to diverging requirements in our European markets, which could increase vehicle complexity and duties.", "There is an increasing trend of city access restrictions for internal combustion engine powered vehicles.", "The access rules being introduced are developed by individual cities based on their specific concerns, resulting in rapid deployment of access rules that differ greatly among cities.", "The speed of implementation of access rules may directly influence customer vehicle residual values and choice of next purchase.", "In an effort to support the Paris Accord, some countries are adopting yearly increases in CO2 taxes, where such a system is in place, and publishing dates by when internal combustion powered vehicles may no longer be registered, e.g., Norway in 2025 and the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in 2030.", "Other National Requirements.", "Many countries, in an effort to address air quality and climate change concerns, are adopting previous versions of European or United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (“UN-ECE”) mobile source emission regulations.", "Some countries have adopted more advanced regulations based on the most recent version of European or U.S. regulations.", "For example, the China Stage VI light-duty vehicle emission standards, based on European Stage VI emission standards for light-duty vehicles, U.S. evaporative and refueling emissions standards, and CARB OBD II requirements, incorporate two levels of stringency for tailpipe emissions.", "Under the level one (VI(a)) standard, which is currently in place nationwide in China, the emissions limits are comparable to the EU Stage VI limits, except for carbon monoxide, which is 30% lower than the EU Stage VI limit.", "The more stringent level two (VI(b)) standard’s emissions limits are approximately 30-50% lower than the EU Stage VI limits, depending on the pollutant.", "While level two (VI(b)) is not slated for nationwide implementation until July 2023, the government has encouraged the more economically developed cities and provinces to pull ahead implementation.", "For example, Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hebei province, and Guangdong province have all begun implementing level two (VI(b)).", "Both China Stage VII light-duty vehicle and heavy duty vehicle emission regulations are currently under pre-study, and the Ministry of Ecology and Environment has advised that the Stage VII regulations will have more stringent limits on pollutant emissions and will establish limits for greenhouse gas (primarily CO2) tailpipe emissions.", "In South America, most countries are evolving to implement more stringent requirements accepting Europe and U.S. regulations, except Brazil, which has a unique local process called PROCONVE based on U.S. regulations for light-duty vehicles and European regulations for heavy-duty vehicles.", "Canadian criteria emissions regulations are largely aligned with U.S. requirements; however, the existing ZEV regulations in Quebec and those published in British Columbia in July 2020 are more stringent than those in place in California.", "Both British Columbia and Quebec have proposed draft amendments to their regulations to increase requirements starting in 2025 and 2026, respectively.", "The federal government has published draft light-duty ZEV sales requirements through an amendment to the Passenger Automobile and Light Truck Greenhouse Gas Emission Regulations and has also published its intent to develop ZEV sales requirements for heavy-duty vehicles.", "Other provinces have signaled their interest in light-duty ZEV sales regulations but are awaiting the finalization of the federal ZEV regulations.", "Elsewhere, there is a mix of regulations and processes based on U.S. and EU standards.", "Not all countries have adopted appropriate fuel quality standards to accompany the stringent emission standards adopted.", "This could lead to compliance problems, particularly if OBD or in-use surveillance requirements are implemented.", "Global Developments.", "In recent years, EPA and CARB have increased their focus on the use of “defeat devices.” Defeat devices are elements of design (typically embedded in software) that improperly cause the emission control system to function less effectively during normal on-road driving than during an official laboratory emissions test, without justification.", "They are prohibited by law in many jurisdictions, and we do not use defeat devices in our vehicles.", "Regulators around the world continue to scrutinize automakers’ emission testing, which has led to a number of defeat device settlements by various manufacturers.", "EPA is carrying out additional non-standard tests as part of its vehicle certification program.", "CARB has also been conducting extensive non-standard emission tests, which in some cases have resulted in certification delays for diesel vehicles.", "In the past, several European countries have conducted non-standard emission tests and published the results, and, in some cases, this supplemental testing has triggered investigations of manufacturers for possible defeat devices.", "Testing is expected to continue on an ongoing basis.", "In addition, plaintiffs’ attorneys are pursuing consumer class action lawsuits based on alleged excessive emissions from cars and trucks, which could, in turn, prompt further investigations by regulators.", "U.S.", "Requirements - Light-Duty Vehicles.", "Federal law requires that light-duty vehicles meet minimum corporate average fuel economy (“CAFE”) standards set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”).", "Manufacturers are subject to substantial civil penalties if they fail to meet the CAFE standard in any model year, after taking into account all available credits for the preceding five model years and expected credits for the three succeeding model years.", "The law requires NHTSA to promulgate and enforce separate CAFE standards applicable to each manufacturer’s fleet of domestic passenger cars, imported passenger cars, and light-duty trucks.", "EPA also regulates vehicle greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions under the Clean Air Act.", "Because the vast majority of GHGs emitted by a vehicle are the result of fuel combustion, GHG emission standards are similar to fuel economy standards.", "Thus, NHTSA and EPA coordinate with each other on their fuel economy and GHG standards, respectively, to avoid potential inconsistencies.", "Beginning with the 2012 model year, EPA and NHTSA jointly promulgated harmonized GHG and fuel economy regulations under what came to be known as the “One National Program” (“ONP”) framework.", "California, which had promulgated its own state-specific set of GHG regulations, agreed that compliance with the federal program would satisfy compliance with its own GHG requirements, thereby avoiding a patchwork of potentially conflicting federal and state GHG standards.", "ONP has required manufacturers to achieve increasingly stringent year-over-year standards.", "ONP was envisioned to continue at least through the 2025 model year.", "In 2020, EPA introduced significantly less stringent fuel economy and GHG standards applicable to model years 2021-2026.", "The federal government also revoked California’s authority to set and enforce its own vehicle GHG standards, as well as the authority of other states that opted in to California’s standards.", "California continued to assert its authority to regulate vehicle GHGs, challenged in court the federal government’s preemption actions, withdrew from ONP, and planned to return to enforcing its own state-specific GHG standards.", "The litigation over both standards and preemption, with uncertain outcomes, created difficulty for purposes of Ford’s future product planning.", "To avoid a “bifurcated” regulatory scenario in which California and the 15 other states that adopted California’s GHG standards enforce one set of rules, while a different set of rules applies in the rest of the country, Ford reached an agreement with California on a set of terms for an alternative framework in which Ford committed to meet a designated set of standards on a national basis in lieu of the California regulatory program.", "This framework enabled Ford to continue its product planning on a nationwide basis, while being consistent with Ford’s environmental goals.", "Ford finalized its agreement with California in 2020, and other states that adopted the California standards indicated they would respect the agreement.", "In 2021, EPA again re-evaluated the stringency of light-duty fuel economy and GHG standards through the 2026 model year, and considered whether to restore the stringency to the previous ONP levels, or greater.", "EPA finalized this evaluation in December 2021, establishing GHG standards applicable to model years 2023-2026 with stringency that exceeded ONP levels.", "In 2022, NHTSA finalized more stringent fuel economy standards for model years 2024-2026, which are substantially aligned with EPA’s GHG standards.", "The federal government also acted in December 2021 to repeal its rule blocking California’s authority to set and enforce its own vehicle GHG standards, as well as the authority of other states that adopted California’s standards, and EPA took similar action in early 2022 under the Clean Air Act.", "In late 2022, EPA began consideration of sweeping changes to light-duty GHG regulations for model years 2027 and beyond.", "These regulations are expected to extend through at least the 2030 model year, and to drive significant ZEV sales mix, along with rapid improvement of ICE vehicle performance, by virtue of greatly increased stringency.", "These new rules are expected to impose increased challenges and costs on the development of light-duty vehicles.", "If any federal or state agency imposes and enforces fuel economy and GHG standards that are misaligned with market conditions, Ford would likely be forced to take various actions that could have substantial adverse effects on its sales volumes and results of operations.", "Such actions likely would include restricting offerings of selected engines and popular options; increasing market support programs for Ford’s most fuel-efficient vehicles; and ultimately curtailing the production and sale of certain vehicles, such as high-performance cars, utilities, and/or full-size light trucks in order to maintain compliance.", "U.S.", "Requirements - Heavy-Duty Vehicles.", "EPA and NHTSA have jointly promulgated GHG and fuel economy standards for heavy-duty vehicles (generally, vehicles over 8,500 pounds gross vehicle weight rating) through the 2027 model year, and EPA is preparing a major update to these standards for the 2027 model year and beyond.", "In Ford’s case, the standards primarily affect heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans, plus vocational vehicles such as shuttle buses and delivery trucks.", "As the heavy-duty standards increase in stringency, it may become more difficult to comply while continuing to offer a full lineup of heavy-duty trucks.", "European Requirements.", "The European Union regulates passenger car and light commercial vehicle CO2 emissions using sliding scales with different CO2 targets for each manufacturer based on the respective average vehicle weight for its fleet of vehicles first registered in a calendar year, with separate targets for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.", "A penalty system applies to manufacturers failing to meet the individual CO2 targets.", "Pooling agreements between manufacturers to utilize credits are possible under certain conditions, and we have entered into such pooling agreements in order to comply with fuel economy regulations without paying a penalty and to enable other manufacturers to benefit from our positive CO2 performance.", "For “multi-stage vehicles” (e.g., Ford’s Transit chassis cabs), the base manufacturer (e.g., Ford) is fully responsible for the CO2 performance of the final up-fitted vehicles.", "The initial target levels get significantly more stringent every five years (2025, 2030, and 2035, after which all new vehicles must be zero emission), requiring significant investments in propulsion technologies and extensive fleet management forcing low CO2 emissions.", "The United Kingdom and Switzerland have introduced similar rules, and the United Kingdom is considering adopting ZEV mandates.", "The EU Commission is investigating the introduction of Real Driving CO2 and Life Cycle Assessment elements, and heavy-duty vehicles are addressed in separate regulations with analogous requirements and challenges.", "As discussed above, the EU Commission has announced a “Green Deal” that is likely to trigger more stringent requirements for CO2 emissions (including stricter CO2 fleet regulations) and other regulated emissions and include recycling and substance restrictions.", "While the EU Commission targets net climate neutrality by 2050 and a more ambitious 2030 interim target (a 55% instead of 40% CO2 reduction compared to 1990), several countries, such as Germany, have adopted stricter interim targets and earlier net climate neutrality targets.", "Ford also faces the risk of advance premium payments for both passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in all European markets due to, for example, unexpected market fluctuations and shorter lead times impacting average fleet performance.", "The United Nations developed a technical regulation for passenger car emissions and CO2.", "This world light-duty test procedure (“WLTP”) is focused primarily on better aligning laboratory CO2 and fuel consumption figures with customer- reported figures.", "The introduction of WLTP in Europe started in September 2017 and requires updates to CO2 labeling, thereby impacting taxes in countries with a CO2 tax scheme as well as CO2 fleet regulations for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.", "Costs associated with new or incremental testing for WLTP are significant.", "Some European countries have implemented or are considering other initiatives for reducing CO2 vehicle emissions, including fiscal measures and CO2 labeling to address country specific targets associated with the Paris Accord.", "For example, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands, among others, have introduced taxation based on CO2 emissions.", "The EU CO2 requirements are likely to trigger further measures.", "In addition, delayed vehicle launches and supply shortages, as well as an insufficient charging infrastructure and lower demand for ZEV and low CO2 emission vehicles as certain electric vehicle incentives are reduced, can trigger compliance risks in all European markets.", "Other National Requirements.", "The Canadian federal government regulates vehicle GHG emissions under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.", "In

critical to the success of our Ford+ plan.", "If we are unable to optimize our capital allocation among vehicles, services, technology, and other calls on capital, or we are otherwise not successful in executing Ford+ (or are delayed for reasons outside of our control), we may not be able to realize the full benefits of our plan, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.", "Furthermore, if we fail to make progress on our plan at the pace that shareholders expect, it may lead to an increase in shareholder activism, which may disrupt the conduct of our business and divert management’s attention and resources.", "Ford’s vehicles could be affected by defects that result in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, or increased warranty costs.", "Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy defects related to vehicle safety through safety recall campaigns, and a manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines that the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard.", "We may also be obligated to remedy defects or potentially recall our vehicles due to defective components provided to us by our suppliers, arising from their quality issues or otherwise.", "NHTSA’s enforcement strategy has resulted in significant civil penalties being levied and the use of consent orders requiring direct oversight by NHTSA of certain manufacturers’ safety processes, a trend that could continue.", "Should we or government safety regulators determine that a safety or other defect or a noncompliance exists with respect to certain of our vehicles prior to the start of production, the launch of such vehicle could be delayed until such defect is remedied.", "The cost of recall and customer satisfaction actions to remedy defects in vehicles that have been sold could be substantial, particularly if the actions relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production.", "For example, NHTSA and the automotive industry are currently engaged in a study of the safety of approximately 56 million Takata desiccated airbag inflators in the United States.", "Of these, approximately three and a half million of the inflators are in our vehicles.", "Should NHTSA determine that the inflators contain a safety defect, Ford and other manufacturers could potentially face significant incremental recall costs.", "Further, to the extent recall and customer satisfaction actions relate to defective components we receive from suppliers, our ability to recover from the suppliers may be limited by the suppliers’ financial condition.", "We accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages and field service actions at the time a vehicle is sold, and we reevaluate the adequacy of our accruals on a regular basis.", "In addition, from time to time, we issue extended warranties at our expense, the estimated cost of which is accrued at the time of issuance.", "For additional information regarding warranty and field service action costs, including our process for establishing our reserves, see “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Item 7 and Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.", "If warranty costs are greater than anticipated as a result of increased vehicle and component complexity, the adoption of new technologies, or otherwise, such costs could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.", "Furthermore, launch delays, recall actions, and increased warranty costs could adversely affect our reputation or market acceptance of our products as discussed below under “Ford’s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries, and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced.”", "Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, or new business strategies.", "We have invested in, formed strategic alliances with, and announced or formed joint ventures with a number of companies, and we may expand those relationships or enter into similar relationships with additional companies.", "These initiatives typically involve enormous complexity, may require a significant amount of capital, and may involve a lengthy regulatory approval process.", "As a result, we may not be able to complete anticipated transactions, the anticipated benefits of these transactions may not be realized, or the benefits may be delayed.", "For example, we may not successfully integrate an alliance or joint venture with our operations, including the implementation of our controls, systems, procedures, and policies, or unforeseen expenses or liabilities may arise that were not discovered during due diligence prior to an investment or entry into a strategic alliance, or a misalignment of interests may develop between us and the other party.", "Further, to the extent we share ownership, control, or management with another party in a joint venture, our ability to influence the joint venture may be limited, and we may be unable to prevent misconduct or implement our compliance or internal control systems.", "In order to secure critical materials for production of electric vehicles, we have entered into and plan to continue to enter into offtake agreements and other long-term purchase contracts with raw materials suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers; however, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these actions and our efforts to have such suppliers, particularly those in less developed markets, adopt Ford’s sustainability and other standards may be unsuccessful, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation.", "In addition, a restructuring or the implementation of a new or different business strategy may lead to the disruption of our existing business operations, including distracting management from current operations.", "Results of operations from new activities may be lower than our existing activities, and, if a strategy is unsuccessful, we may not recoup our investments, which may be significant, in that strategy.", "Moreover, we may continue to have financial exposure following a strategic divestiture or cessation of operations in a market, and restructuring actions may cause us to incur significant costs, record impairments or other charges, subject us to potential claims from employees, suppliers, dealers, or governmental authorities or harm our reputation.", "Failure to successfully and timely realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions or strategies described herein could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.", "Operational systems, security systems, vehicles, and services could be affected by cyber incidents, ransomware attacks, and other disruptions and impact Ford and Ford Credit as well as their suppliers and dealers.", "We rely on information technology networks and systems, including in-vehicle systems and mobile devices, some of which are managed by suppliers, to process, transmit, and store electronic information that is important to the operation of our business, our vehicles, and the services we offer.", "Despite security measures, we are at risk for interruptions, outages, and compromises of: (i) operational systems (including business, financial, accounting, product development, consumer receivables, data processing, or manufacturing processes); (ii) facility security systems; and/or (iii) in-vehicle systems or mobile devices, whether caused by a ransomware or other cyber attack, security breach, or other reasons, e.g., a natural disaster, fire, acts of terrorism or war, or an overburdened infrastructure system.", "Such incidents could materially disrupt operational systems; result in loss of trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information; compromise the privacy of personal information of consumers, employees, or others; jeopardize the security of our facilities; affect the performance of in-vehicle systems or services we offer; and/or impact the safety of our vehicles.", "This risk exposure rises as we continue to develop and produce vehicles with increased connectivity.", "Moreover, we, our suppliers, and our dealers have been the target of cyber attacks in the past, and such attacks will continue and evolve in the future, which may cause cyber incidents to be more difficult to detect for periods of time.", "Our networks and in-vehicle systems, sharing similar architectures, could also be impacted by, or a data breach may result from, the negligence or misconduct of insiders or third parties who have access to our networks and systems.", "We continually employ capabilities, processes, and other security measures designed to reduce and mitigate the risk of cyber attacks, and we rely on our suppliers to do the same for their operations; however, we may not be aware of all vulnerabilities and such preventative measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be sufficient in all circumstances or mitigate all potential risks, including potential production disruption.", "Moreover, a cyber incident could harm our reputation, cause customers to lose trust in our security measures, and/or subject us to regulatory actions or litigation, which may result in fines, penalties, judgments, or injunctions, and a cyber incident involving us or one of our suppliers could impact production, our internal operations, or our ability to deliver products and services to our customers.", "Ford’s production, as well as Ford’s suppliers’ production, and/or the ability to deliver products to consumers could be disrupted by labor issues, natural or man-made disasters, adverse effects of climate change, financial distress, production difficulties, capacity limitations, or other factors.", "A work stoppage or other limitation on production could occur at Ford’s facilities, at a facility in its supply chain, or at one of its logistics providers for any number of reasons, including as a result of labor issues, including shortages of available employees, disputes under existing collective bargaining agreements with labor unions or in connection with negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements, absenteeism, public health issues (e.g., COVID-19), stay-at-home orders, or in response to potential restructuring actions (e.g., plant closures); as a result of supplier financial distress or other production constraints, such as limited quantities of components, including but not limited to semiconductors, or raw materials, quality issues, capacity limitations, or other difficulties; as a result of a natural disaster (including climate-related physical risk); cyber incidents; or for other reasons.", "Further, the limited availability of components, labor shortages, COVID-19, and supplier operating issues has led to an inconsistent production schedule at our facilities.", "This has exacerbated the disruption to our suppliers’ operations, which, in turn, has led to higher costs and production shortfalls.", "Given the worldwide scope of our supply chain and operations, we and our suppliers face a risk of disruption or operating inefficiencies that may increase costs due to the adverse physical effects of climate change, which are predicted to increase the frequency and severity of weather and other natural events, e.g., wildfires, extended droughts, and extreme temperatures.", "In addition, in the event a weather-related event, strike, international conflict, or other occurrence limits the ability of freight carriers to deliver components and other materials from suppliers to us or logistics providers to transport our vehicles for an extended period of time, it may increase our costs and delay or otherwise impact both our production operations and customers’ ability to receive our vehicles.", "Many components used in our vehicles are available only from a single or limited number of suppliers and, therefore, cannot be re-sourced quickly or inexpensively to another supplier (due to long lead times, new contractual commitments that may be required by another supplier before ramping up to provide the components or materials, etc.).", "Such suppliers also could threaten to disrupt our production as leverage in negotiations.", "In addition, when we undertake a model changeover, significant downtime at one or more of our production facilities may be required, and our ability to return to full production may be delayed if we experience production difficulties at one of our facilities or a supplier’s facility.", "Moreover, as vehicles, components, and their integration become more complex, we may face an increased risk of a delay in production of new vehicles.", "Regardless of the cause, our ability to recoup lost production volume may be limited.", "Accordingly, a significant disruption to our production schedule could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and may impact our strategy to comply with fuel economy standards as discussed below under “Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations.”", "Ford’s ability to maintain a competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraints.", "The vast majority of the hourly employees in our Ford Blue and Ford Model e manufacturing operations in the United States and Canada are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements.", "These agreements provide guaranteed wage and benefit levels throughout the contract term and some degree of income security, subject to certain conditions.", "These agreements may restrict our ability to close plants and divest businesses.", "A substantial number of our employees in other regions are represented by unions or government councils, and legislation or custom promoting retention of manufacturing or other employment in the state, country, or region may constrain as a practical matter our ability to sell or close manufacturing or other facilities.", "Ford’s ability to attract and retain talented, diverse, and highly skilled employees is critical to its success and competitiveness.", "Our success depends on our ability to continue to recruit and retain talented and diverse employees who are highly skilled in engineering, software, technology (including digital capabilities and connectivity), marketing, and finance, among other areas.", "Competition for such employees is intense, which has led to an increase in compensation throughout a tight labor market, and, accordingly, may increase costs for employers.", "We have struggled to hire and retain salaried, skilled hourly, and production hourly employees in some of our manufacturing and parts, supplies, and logistics locations.", "In addition to compensation considerations, current and potential employees are increasingly placing a premium on various intangibles, such as working for companies with a clear purpose and strong brand reputation, flexible work arrangements, and other considerations, such as embracing sustainability and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.", "If we are not perceived as an employer of choice, we may be unable to recruit highly skilled employees.", "Further, if we lose existing employees with needed skills, or we are unable to upskill and develop existing employees, particularly with the introduction of new technologies, it could have a substantial adverse effect on our business.", "Ford’s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries, and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced.", "Although we conduct extensive market research before launching new or refreshed vehicles and introducing new services, many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products and services in the marketplace, and we may not be able to accurately predict or identify emerging trends or preferences or the success of new products or services in the market.", "It takes years to design and develop a new vehicle or change an existing vehicle.", "Because customers’ preferences may change quickly, our new and existing products may not generate sales in sufficient quantities and at costs low enough to be profitable and recoup investment costs.", "Offering vehicles and services that customers want and value can mitigate the risks of increasing price competition and declining demand, but products and services that are perceived to be less desirable (whether in terms of price, quality, styling, safety, overall value, fuel efficiency, or other attributes) can exacerbate these risks.", "For example, if we are unable to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors, develop innovative new products and services, or sufficiently tailor our products and services to customers in other markets, there could be insufficient demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.", "With increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet, social media, and other media, mere allegations relating to quality, safety, fuel efficiency, sustainability, corporate social responsibility, or other key attributes can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our products or services, even where such allegations prove to be inaccurate or unfounded.", "Further, our ability to successfully grow through capacity expansion and investments in the areas of electrification, connectivity, digital and physical services, and software services depends on many factors, including advancements in technology, regulatory changes, infrastructure development (e.g., a widespread vehicle charging network), and other factors that are difficult to predict, that may significantly affect the future of electric and autonomous vehicles, digital and physical services, and software services.", "The automotive, software, and digital service businesses are very competitive and are undergoing rapid changes.", "Traditional competitors are expanding their offerings, and new types of competitors (particularly in our areas of strength, e.g., pick-up trucks, utilities, and commercial vehicles) that may possess superior technology, may have business models with certain aspects that are more efficient, and are not subject to the same level of fixed costs as us, are entering the market.", "This level of competition increases the importance of our ability to anticipate, develop, and deliver products and services that customers desire on a timely basis, in quantities in line with demand, and at costs low enough to be profitable.", "We have announced our intent to continue making multi-billion dollar investments in electrification and software services.", "Our plans include offering electrified versions of many of our vehicles, including the F-150 Lightning and E-Transit.", "If the market for electrified vehicles does not develop at the rate we expect, even if the regulatory framework encourages a rapid adoption of electrified vehicles, there is a negative perception of our vehicles or about electric vehicles in general, or if consumers prefer our competitors’ vehicles, there could be an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.", "Further, as discussed below under “Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations,” lower than planned market acceptance of our vehicles may impact our strategy to comply with fuel economy standards.", "Ford is addressing its impact on climate change aligned with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (Paris Agreement) by working to reduce our carbon footprint over time across our vehicles, operations, and supply chain.", "We have announced interim emissions targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and made other statements about similar initiatives, e.g., our expected electric vehicle volumes in future years.", "Achievement of these initiatives will require significant investments and the implementation of new processes; however, there is no assurance that the desired outcomes will be achieved.", "To the extent we are unable to achieve these initiatives or our transition to electrification is slower than expected, it may harm our reputation or we may not otherwise receive the expected return on the investment.", "For example, we are exposed to reputational risk if we do not reduce vehicle CO2 emissions in line with our targets or in compliance with applicable regulations.", "Further, our customers and investors evaluate how well we are progressing on our announced climate goals and aspirations, and if we are not on track to achieve those goals and aspirations on a timely basis, or if the expectations of our customers and investors change and we do not adequately address their expectations, our reputation could be impacted, and customers may choose to purchase the products and services of, investors may choose to invest in, and suppliers and vendors may choose to do business with other companies.", "Moreover, new offerings, including those related to electric vehicles and autonomous driving technologies, may present technological challenges that could be costly to implement and overcome and may subject us to customer claims if they do not operate as anticipated.", "In addition, since new technologies are subject to market acceptance, a malfunction involving any manufacturer’s autonomous vehicle may negatively impact the perception of autonomous vehicles and erode customer trust.", "Ford’s results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United States.", "A shift in consumer preferences away from larger, more profitable vehicles with internal combustion engines (including trucks and utilities) to electric or other vehicles in our portfolio that may be less profitable could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.", "If demand for electric vehicles grows at a rate greater than our ability to increase our production capacity for those vehicles, lower market share and revenue, as well as facility and other asset-related charges (e.g., accelerated depreciation) associated with the production of internal combustion vehicles, may result.", "In addition, government regulations aimed at reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency (e.g., ZEV mandates and low emission zones) and other factors that accelerate the transition to electric vehicles may increase the cost of vehicles by more than the perceived benefit to consumers and dampen margins.", "With a global footprint, Ford’s results could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments, including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events.", "Because of the interconnectedness of the global economy, the challenges of a pandemic, a financial crisis, economic downturn or recession, natural disaster, war, geopolitical crises, or other significant events in one area of the world can have an immediate and material adverse impact on markets around the world.", "Changes in international trade policy can also have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.", "Steps taken by governments to apply or consider applying tariffs on automobiles, parts, and other products and materials have the potential to disrupt existing supply chains, impose additional costs on our business, and may lead to other countries attempting to retaliate by imposing tariffs, which would make our products more expensive for customers, and, in turn, could make our products less competitive.", "In particular, China presents unique risks to U.S. automakers due to the strain in U.S.-China relations, China’s unique regulatory landscape, and the level of integration with key components in our global supply chain.", "Ford has operations in various markets with volatile economic or political environments.", "This may expose us to heightened risks as a result of economic, geopolitical, or other events, including governmental takeover (i.e., nationalization) of our manufacturing facilities or intellectual property, restrictive exchange or import controls, disruption of operations as a result of systemic political or economic instability, outbreak of war or expansion of hostilities (such as the actions taken by Russia in Ukraine), and acts of terrorism, each of which could impact our supply chain as well as our operations and have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.", "Further, the U.S. government, other governments, and international organizations could impose additional sanctions or export controls that could restrict us from doing business directly or indirectly in or with certain countries or parties, which could include affiliates.", "Industry sales volume can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis, recession, or significant geopolitical event.", "Because we, like other manufacturers, have a higher proportion of fixed structural costs, relatively small changes in industry sales volume can have a substantial effect on our cash flow and results of operations.", "Vehicle sales are affected by overall economic and market conditions and developing trends such as shared vehicle ownership and the transportation as a service model, e.g., ridesharing services.", "If industry vehicle sales were to decline to levels significantly below our planning assumption, the decline could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.", "For a discussion of economic trends, see Item 7.", "Ford may face increased price competition or a reduction in demand for its products resulting from industry excess capacity, currency fluctuations, competitive actions, or other factors.", "The global automotive industry is intensely competitive, with installed manufacturing capacity generally exceeding current demand.", "Historically, industry overcapacity has resulted in many manufacturers offering marketing incentives on vehicles in an attempt to maintain and grow market share; these incentives historically have included a combination of subsidized financing or leasing programs, price rebates, and other incentives.", "As a result, we are not necessarily able to set our prices to offset higher marketing incentives, commodity or other cost increases, tariffs, or the impact of adverse currency fluctuations.", "This risk includes cost advantages foreign competitors may have because of their weaker home market currencies, which may, in turn, enable those competitors to offer their products at lower prices.", "Further, higher inventory levels put downward pressure on pricing, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.", "As the automotive industry transitions to electric vehicles, excess capacity, particularly for internal combustion engine trucks and utilities, may continue or increase.", "This excess capacity may further increase price competition in that segment of the market, which could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.", "Inflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and market value of Ford or Ford Credit’s investments, including marketable securities, can have a significant effect on results.", "We and our suppliers are exposed to inflationary pressure and a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates.", "We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce potentially adverse effects on our business.", "Changes in commodity and energy prices (from tariffs and the actions taken by Russia in Ukraine, as discussed above under “With a global footprint, Ford’s results could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments, including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events,” or otherwise), currency exchange rates, and interest rates cannot always be predicted, hedged, or offset with price increases to eliminate earnings volatility.", "As a result, significant changes in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, or interest rates as well as increased material, freight, logistics, and similar costs could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.", "See Item 7 and Item 7A for additional discussion of currency, commodity and energy price, and interest rate risks.", "For example, interest rates have increased significantly as central banks in developed countries attempt to subdue inflation while government deficits and debt remain at high levels in many global markets.", "Accordingly, the eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt, tighter monetary policy, and potentially higher long-term interest rates may drive a higher cost of capital for the business.", "At Ford Credit, rising interest rates may impact Ford Credit’s ability to source funding and offer financing at competitive rates, which could reduce its financing margin.", "In addition, our results are impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments, with unrealized gains and losses that could be material in any period.", "Ford and Ford Credit’s access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors.", "Ford and Ford Credit’s ability to obtain unsecured funding at a reasonable cost is dependent on their credit ratings or their perceived creditworthiness.", "Further, Ford Credit’s ability to obtain securitized funding under its committed asset-backed liquidity programs and certain other asset-backed securitization transactions is subject to having a sufficient amount of assets eligible for these programs, as well as Ford Credit’s ability to obtain appropriate credit ratings and, for certain committed programs, derivatives to manage the interest rate risk.", "Over time, and particularly in the event of credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, or other factors, Ford Credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates because of funding constraints.", "In addition, Ford Credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates if there is a significant decline in the demand for the types of securities it offers or Ford Credit is unable to obtain derivatives to manage the interest rate risk associated with its securitization transactions.", "A significant reduction in the amount of receivables Ford Credit purchases or originates would significantly reduce its ongoing results of operations and could adversely affect its ability to support the sale of Ford vehicles.", "Furthermore, in addition to rising interest rates adversely affecting overall economic activity and the financial condition of our customers, increases in interest rates could cause credit market disruptions, which have historically resulted in higher borrower costs and made it more difficult to access the markets, obtain financing on favorable terms, and fund our operations.", "The impact of government incentives on Ford’s business could be significant, and Ford’s receipt of government incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback.", "We receive economic benefits from national, state, and local governments in various regions of the world in the form of incentives designed to encourage manufacturers to establish, maintain, or increase investment, workforce, or production.", "These incentives may take various forms, including grants, loan subsidies, or tax abatements or credits.", "The impact of these incentives can be significant in a particular market during a reporting period.", "A decrease in, expiration without renewal of, or other cessation or clawback of government incentives for any of our business units, as a result of administrative decision or otherwise, could have a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.", "Until 2021, most of our manufacturing facilities in South America were located in Brazil, where the state or federal governments historically offered significant incentives to manufacturers to encourage capital investment, increase manufacturing production, and create jobs.", "As a result, the performance of our South American operations had been impacted favorably by government incentives to a substantial extent.", "The federal government in Brazil has levied assessments against us concerning the federal incentives we previously received, and the State of São Paulo has challenged the grant to us of tax incentives by the State of Bahia.", "See Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for discussion of our accounting for government incentives, and “Item 3.", "Legal Proceedings” for a discussion of tax proceedings in Brazil and the potential requirement for us to post collateral.", "The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) provides, among other things, financial incentives in the form of tax credits to grow the domestic supply chain and domestic manufacturing base for electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), and other “clean” vehicles.", "The law likewise incentivizes the purchase of clean vehicles and the infrastructure to fuel them.", "These incentives are phasing in and will remain in effect until approximately 2032, unless modified by Congress.", "The IRA’s incentives are having and are expected to have material impacts on the automotive industry and Ford.", "The IRA authorizes tax credits to manufacturers for the domestic production of batteries and battery components for EVs and PHEVs and to purchasers of qualified commercial and retail clean vehicles.", "Ford expects that many customers will be able to monetize the commercial clean vehicle credit in light of Ford’s range of electrified product offerings for commercial applications.", "When paired with the IRA’s tax credit for the construction of certain electric vehicle charging infrastructure, Ford expects the commercial clean vehicle credit will significantly influence commercial fleets in their evaluation of a transition from internal combustion engine vehicles to EVs and PHEVs.", "To claim the retail tax credit, the IRA establishes numerous and complex prerequisites, including that the vehicle must be assembled in North America; the vehicle must be under specified limitations on manufacturer suggested retail price (“MSRP”); purchaser income limitations; starting in 2024, any vehicle that contains “battery components” that were “manufactured or assembled” by a “foreign entity of concern” will be ineligible; and, starting in 2025, any vehicle that contains battery materials that were “extracted, processed, or recycled” by a “foreign entity of concern” will be ineligible.", "A “Critical Minerals Credit” is available for those vehicles that have a specified percentage of critical minerals that are “extracted or produced” in the United States, in a country with which the United States has a Free Trade Agreement, or that is “recycled” in North America.", "A “Battery Components Credit” is available for those vehicles that have a specified percentage of “value” of its battery “components” that are “manufactured or assembled” in North America.", "Although we ultimately expect the IRA to benefit Ford and the automotive industry in general, the availability of such benefits will depend on the further development and improvement of the U.S. battery supply, sufficient access to raw materials within the scope of the IRA, and the terms of the regulations and guidance (and the limitations therein) the U.S. government issues to implement the IRA, which will ultimately determine which vehicles qualify for incentives and the amount thereof.", "For example, in late 2022 interim guidance was released on how to apply the MSRP limitations to the retail clean vehicle credit, and subjected a significant number of SUVs to a lower MSRP limitation than the industry expected, thereby excluding vehicles that may otherwise be eligible for the credit.", "Automakers that better optimize eligibility for their vehicles, as compared to their competition, will have a competitive advantage.", "Ford Credit could experience higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values, or higher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles.", "Credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer’s or dealer’s failure to make payments according to contract terms.", "Credit risk (which is heavily dependent upon economic factors including unemployment, consumer debt service burden, personal income growth, dealer profitability, and used car prices) has a significant impact on Ford Credit’s business.", "The level of credit losses Ford Credit may experience could exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations.", "In addition, Ford Credit projects expected residual values (including residual value support payments from Ford) and return volumes for the vehicles it leases.", "Actual proceeds realized by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned leased vehicles at lease termination may be lower than the amount projected, which would reduce Ford Credit’s return on the lease transaction.", "Among the factors that can affect the value of returned lease vehicles are the volume and mix of vehicles returned industry-wide, economic conditions, marketing programs, and quality or perceived quality, safety, fuel efficiency, or reliability of the vehicles, or changes in propulsion technology and related legislative changes.", "Actual return volumes may be influenced by these factors, as well as by contractual lease-end values relative to auction values.", "In 2022, Ford Credit experienced lower-than-expected return volumes.", "If auction values decrease significantly in the future, return volumes could exceed Ford Credit’s expectations.", "Each of these factors, alone or in combination, has the potential to adversely affect Ford Credit’s results of operations if actual results were to differ significantly from Ford Credit’s projections.", "See “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Item 7 for additional discussion.", "Economic and demographic experience for pension and OPEB plans (e.g., discount rates or investment returns) could be worse than Ford has assumed.", "The measurement of our obligations, costs, and liabilities associated with benefits pursuant to our pension and OPEB plans requires that we estimate the present value of projected future payments to all participants.", "We use many assumptions in calculating these estimates, including assumptions related to discount rates, investment returns on designated plan assets, and demographic experience (e.g., mortality and retirement rates).", "We generally remeasure these estimates at each year end and recognize any gains or losses associated with changes to our plan assets and liabilities in the year incurred.", "To the extent actual results are less favorable than our assumptions, we may", "recognize a remeasurement loss in our results, which could be substantial.", "For additional information regarding our assumptions, see “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Item 7 and Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.", "Pension and other postretirement liabilities could adversely affect Ford’s liquidity and financial condition.", "We have defined benefit retirement plans in the United States that cover many of our hourly and salaried employees.", "We also provide pension benefits to non-U.S. employees and retirees, primarily in Europe.", "In addition, we sponsor plans to provide OPEB for retired employees (primarily health care and life insurance benefits).", "See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information about these plans.", "These benefit plans impose significant liabilities on us and could require us to make additional cash contributions, which could impair our liquidity.", "If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to meet any pension or OPEB obligations, we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, suspend dividend payments, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness.", "Ford and Ford Credit could experience unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations, or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in products, services, perceived environmental impacts, or otherwise.", "We spend substantial resources to comply with governmental safety regulations, mobile and stationary source emissions regulations, consumer and automotive financial regulations, and other standards, but we cannot ensure that employees or other individuals affiliated with us will not violate such laws or regulations.", "In addition, as discussed below under “Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations” and “Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations, consumer protection regulations, or other regulations,” regulatory standards and interpretations may change on short notice and impact our compliance status.", "Government investigations against Ford or Ford Credit could result in fines, penalties, or orders that could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or the operation of our business.", "Moreover, compliance with governmental standards does not necessarily prevent individual or class action lawsuits, which can entail significant cost and risk.", "In certain circumstances, courts may permit civil actions even where our vehicles, services, and financial products comply with federal and/or other applicable law.", "Furthermore, simply responding to actual or threatened litigation or government investigations of our compliance with regulatory standards, whether related to our products, services, or business or commercial relationships, requires significant expenditures of time and other resources.", "Litigation also is inherently uncertain, and we could experience significant adverse results, including compensatory and punitive damage awards, a disgorgement of profits or revenue, or injunctive relief, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or our business in general.", "In addition, adverse publicity surrounding an allegation may cause significant reputational harm that could have a significant adverse effect on our sales.", "Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations.", "The automotive industry is subject to regulations worldwide that govern product characteristics and that differ by global region, country, and sometimes within national boundaries.", "Further, additional and new regulations continue to be proposed to address concerns regarding the environment (including concerns about global climate change and its impact), vehicle safety, and energy independence, and the regulatory landscape can change on short notice.", "These regulations vary, but generally require that over time motor vehicles and engines emit less air pollution, including greenhouse gas emissions, oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter.", "Similarly, we are making substantial investments in our facilities and revising our processes to not only comply with applicable regulations but also to make our operations more efficient and sustainable.", "As our suppliers make similar investments, those higher costs may be passed on to us.", "In the United States, legal and policy debates on environmental regulations are continuing, with a primary trend toward reducing GHG emissions and increasing vehicle electrification.", "Recently, different federal administrations have either sought to make standards more strict or to make them less strict, with one administration often replacing the regulations enacted by the last.", "Various third parties routinely seek judicial review of these federal regulatory and deregulatory efforts.", "In parallel, California continues to enact increasingly strict emissions standards and requirements for zero emission vehicles, and those actions are also the subject of legal challenges from third parties.", "Court rulings regarding regulatory actions by federal, California, and other state regulators create uncertainty and the potential for applicable regulatory standards to change quickly.", "In addition, many governments regulate local product content and/or impose import requirements with the aim of creating jobs, protecting domestic producers, and influencing the balance of payments.", "We are continuing to make changes to our product cycle plan to improve the fuel economy of our petroleum-powered vehicles and to offer more propulsion choices, such as electrified vehicles, with lower GHG emissions.", "Electrification is our core strategy to comply with current and anticipated environmental laws and regulations in major markets.", "However, there are limits on our ability to reduce emissions and increase fuel economy over a given time frame and many factors are involved that could delay or impede our plans, primarily relating to the cost and effectiveness of available technologies, consumer acceptance of new technologies and changes in vehicle mix (as described in more detail above under “Ford’s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries, and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced”), willingness of consumers to absorb the additional costs of new technologies, the appropriateness (or lack thereof) of certain technologies for use in particular vehicles, the widespread availability (or lack thereof) of supporting infrastructure for new technologies, including charging for electric vehicles, the availability (or lack thereof) of the raw materials and component supply to make batteries and other elements of electric vehicles, and the human, engineering, and financial resources necessary to deploy new technologies across a wide range of products and powertrains in a short time.", "If fuel prices are relatively low and market conditions do not drive consumers to purchase electric vehicles and other highly fuel-efficient vehicles in large numbers, it may be difficult to meet applicable environmental standards without compromising results.", "Moreover, a production disruption, stop ship, limited availability of necessary components, e.g., batteries or the raw materials necessary for their production, lower than planned market acceptance of our vehicles, or other intervening events may cause us to modify our product plans, or, in some cases, purchase credits, in order to comply with standards regarding fuel economy and air pollution, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and/or cause reputational harm.", "Increased scrutiny of automaker emission compliance by regulators around the world has led to new regulations, more stringent enforcement programs, additional field actions, demands for reporting on the field performance of emissions components and higher scrutiny of field data, and/or delays in regulatory approvals.", "The cost to comply with existing government regulations (in addition to the cost of any field service actions that may result from regulatory actions) is substantial and additional regulations, changes in regulatory interpretations, or changes in consumer preferences that affect vehicle mix, as well as a non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, could have a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.", "In addition, a number of governments, as well as non-governmental organizations, publicly assess vehicles to their own protocols.", "The protocols could change, and any negative perception regarding the performance of our vehicles subjected to such tests could reduce future sales.", "Court decisions arising out of consumer and investor litigation could give rise to de facto changes in the interpretation of existing emission laws and regulations, thereby imposing new burdens on manufacturers.", "For more discussion of the impact of standards on our global business, see the “Governmental Standards” discussion in “Item 1.", "Business” above.", "We and other companies continue to develop autonomous vehicle technologies, and the U.S. and foreign governments are continuing to develop the regulatory framework that will govern autonomous vehicles.", "The evolution of the regulatory framework for autonomous vehicles, and the pace of the development of such regulatory framework, may subject us to increased costs and uncertainty, and may ultimately impact our ability to deliver autonomous vehicles and related services that customers want.", "Ford and Ford Credit could be affected by the continued development of more stringent privacy, data use, and data protection laws and regulations as well as consumers’ heightened expectations to safeguard their personal information.", "We are subject to laws, rules,

Consumer Privacy Act) relating to the collection, use, cross-border data transfer, and security of personal information of consumers, employees, or others, including laws that may require us to notify regulators and affected individuals of a data security incident.", "Existing and newly developed laws and regulations may contain broad definitions of personal information, are subject to change and uncertain interpretations by courts and regulators, and may be inconsistent from state to state or country to country.", "Accordingly, complying with such laws and regulations may lead to a decline in consumer engagement or cause us to incur substantial costs to modify our operations or business practices.", "Moreover, regulatory actions seeking to impose significant financial penalties for noncompliance and/or legal actions (including pursuant to laws providing for private rights of action by consumers) could be brought against us in the event of a data compromise, misuse of consumer information, or perceived or actual non-compliance with data protection or privacy requirements.", "Further, any unauthorized release of personal information could harm our reputation, disrupt our business, cause us to expend significant resources, and lead to a loss of consumer confidence resulting in an adverse impact on our business and/or consumers deciding to withhold or withdraw consent for our collection or use of data.", "Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations, consumer protection regulations, or other regulations.", "As a finance company, Ford Credit is highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations in which it operates, which can impose significant additional costs and/or restrictions on its business.", "In the United States, for example, Ford Credit’s operations are subject to regulation and supervision under various federal, state, and local laws, including the federal Truth-in-Lending Act, Consumer Leasing Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and Fair Credit Reporting Act.", "The Dodd-Frank Act directs federal agencies to adopt rules to regulate the finance industry and the capital markets and gives the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) broad rule-making and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer financial protection laws that regulate consumer finance businesses, such as Ford Credit’s automotive financing business.", "Exercise of these powers by the CFPB may increase the costs of, impose additional restrictions on, or otherwise adversely affect companies in the automotive finance business.", "The CFPB has authority to supervise and examine the largest nonbank automotive finance companies, such as Ford Credit, for compliance with consumer financial protection laws.", "Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject Ford Credit to regulatory enforcement actions, including consent orders or similar orders where Ford Credit may be required to revise

evidence at the second trial to show that the roof design of the F-250 was not defective.", "During the second trial in August 2022, a jury found that Pep Boys (the party that sold the tires on the vehicle involved in the rollover accident) was responsible for 30% of the damages, and Ford, as a direct result of the sanctions order prohibiting Ford from presenting its defense, was responsible for 70% of the damages, resulting in $16.8 million in damages being apportioned to Ford.", "The jury subsequently awarded punitive damages against Ford in the amount of $1.7 billion.", "We have filed

line.", "In general, larger vehicles tend to command higher prices and be more profitable than smaller vehicles, both across and within vehicle segments.", "For example, in North America, our larger, more profitable vehicles had an average contribution margin that was 120% of our total average contribution margin across all vehicles, whereas our smaller vehicles had significantly lower contribution margins.", "In addition, government regulations aimed at reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency (e.g., ZEV mandates and low emission zones), and other factors that accelerate the transition to electrified vehicles, may increase the cost of vehicles by more than the perceived benefit to consumers and dampen margins.", "Trade Policy.", "To the extent governments in various regions implement or intensify barriers to imports, such as erecting tariff or non-tariff barriers or manipulating their currency, and provide advantages to local exporters selling into the global

have peaked, as gasoline and natural gas prices recede from the latest spike, core inflation (excluding food and energy prices) remains elevated and is a source of continued cost pressure on businesses and households.", "Interest rates have increased significantly as central banks in developed countries attempt to subdue inflation while government deficits and debt remain at high levels in many global markets.", "Accordingly, the eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt, tighter monetary policy, and potentially higher long-term interest rates may drive a higher cost of capital for the business.", "At Ford Credit, rising interest rates may impact its ability to source funding and offer financing at competitive rates, which could reduce its financing margin.", "Our Automotive segment revenue is generated primarily by sales of vehicles, parts, and accessories.", "Revenue is recorded when control is transferred to our customers (generally, our dealers and

Automotive wholesales are financed (primarily by Ford Credit) immediately upon the sale of vehicles to dealers, which generally occurs shortly after being produced.", "In contrast, our Automotive trade payables are based primarily on industry-standard production supplier payment terms of about 45 days.", "As a result, our cash flow deteriorates if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) decrease while trade payables continue to become due.", "Conversely, our cash flow improves if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) increase while new trade payables are generally not due for about 45 days.", "For example, the suspension of production at most of our assembly plants and lower industry volumes due to COVID-19 in early 2020 resulted in an initial deterioration of our cash flow, while the subsequent resumption of manufacturing operations and return to pre-COVID-19 production levels at most of our assembly plants resulted in a subsequent improvement of our cash flow.", "Even in normal economic conditions, however, these working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow.", "For example, we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables due to our annual summer and December shutdown periods when production, and therefore inventories and wholesale volumes, are usually at their lowest levels, while payables continue to come due and be paid.", "The net impact of this typically results in cash outflows from changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods.", "Our finished product inventory at December 31, 2022 was higher year over year due to production and release scheduling, which resulted in higher sales inventory, in-transit inventory, and units awaiting upfit.", "In response to, or in anticipation of, supplier disruptions, we may stockpile certain components or raw materials to help prevent disruption in our production of vehicles.", "Such actions could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory.", "Moreover, in order to secure critical materials for production of electric vehicles, we have entered into and plan to continue to enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers, including contributing up to $6.6 billion in capital to BlueOval SK, LLC over a five-year period ending in 2026.", "Such investments, which are part of our plan to invest over $50 billion in electric vehicles through 2026, could have an additional adverse impact on our cash in the near-term.", "The terms of the offtake agreements we have entered into, and those we may enter into in the future, vary by transaction, though they generally obligate us to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output produced by the counterparty over an agreed upon period of time.", "The purchase price mechanism included in the offtake agreement is typically based on the market price of the material at the time of delivery.", "The terms also may include conditions to our obligation to purchase the materials, such as quality or minimum output.", "Subject to satisfaction of those conditions, we will be obligated to purchase the materials at the cost determined by the purchase price mechanism.", "Based on the offtake agreements we have entered into thus far, the earliest date by which we could be obligated to purchase any output, subject to satisfaction of the applicable conditions, will be in 2024.", "Financial institutions participate in a supply chain finance (“SCF”) program that enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their Ford receivables (i.e.,

to the Financial Statements for more information regarding our foreign currency exchange contracts.", "Commodity Price Risk.", "Commodity price risk is the possibility that our financial results could be worse than planned because of changes in the prices of commodities used in the production of motor vehicles, such as base metals (e.g., steel, copper, and aluminum), precious metals (e.g., palladium), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene).", "As we transition to a greater mix of electric vehicles, we expect to increase our reliance on lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, among other materials, for batteries.", "Accordingly, our practice is to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk with respect to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we can economically hedge and consistent with our overall risk management strategy.", "In our hedging actions, we use derivative instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts).", "The extent to which we hedge is also impacted by our ability to achieve designated hedge accounting.",

in different magnitudes and at different times, and any changes in fair value would generally be offset by changes in the underlying exposure.", "In addition, our purchasing organization (with guidance from the GRMC, as appropriate) negotiates contracts for the continuous supply of raw materials.", "In some cases, these contracts stipulate minimum purchase amounts and specific prices, and, therefore, play a role in managing commodity price risk.", "Interest Rate Risk.", "Interest rate risk relates to the loss we could incur in our Company cash investment portfolios due to a change in interest rates.", "Our interest rate sensitivity analysis on the investment portfolios includes cash and cash equivalents and net marketable securities.", "At December 31, 2022, Company cash consisted of $0.2 billion of Rivian marketable securities and $32.1 billion of cash in our investment portfolios, compared to $10.6 billion of Rivian marketable securities and $26.0 billion of cash in our investment portfolios at December 31, 2021.", "We invest the portfolios in securities of various types and maturities, the value of which are subject to fluctuations in interest rates.", "The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short-term investments.", "In investing the cash in our investment portfolios, safety of principal is the primary objective and risk- adjusted return is the secondary objective.", "At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our portfolios.", "Assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our portfolios would be reduced by $256 million, as calculated as of December 31, 2022.", "This compares to $250 million, as calculated as of December 31, 2021.", "While these are our best estimates of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected.", "The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve.", "In reality, interest rate changes of this magnitude are rarely instantaneous or parallel.", "Market risk for Ford Credit is the possibility that changes in interest and currency exchange rates will adversely affect cash flow and economic value.", "Interest Rate Risk.", "Generally, Ford Credit’s assets and the related debt have different re-pricing periods, and consequently, respond differently to changes in interest rates.", "Ford Credit’s assets consist primarily of fixed-rate retail financing and operating lease contracts and floating-rate wholesale receivables.", "Fixed-rate retail financing and operating lease contracts generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract.", "Wholesale receivables are originated to finance new and used vehicles held in dealers’ inventory and generally require dealers to pay a floating rate.", "Debt consists primarily of short- and long-term unsecured and securitized debt.", "Ford Credit’s term debt instruments are principally fixed-rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity.", "Ford Credit’s interest rate risk management objective is to reduce volatility in its cash flows and volatility in its economic value from changes in interest rates based on an established risk tolerance that may vary by market.", "Ford Credit uses economic value sensitivity analysis and re-pricing gap analysis to evaluate potential long-term effects of changes in interest rates.", "It then enters into interest rate swaps to convert portions of its floating-rate debt to fixed or its fixed-rate debt to floating to ensure that Ford Credit’s exposure falls within the established tolerances.", "Ford Credit also uses pre-tax cash flow sensitivity analysis to monitor the level of near-term cash flow exposure.", "The pre-tax cash flow sensitivity analysis measures the changes in expected cash flows associated with Ford Credit’s interest-rate-sensitive assets, liabilities, and derivative financial instruments from hypothetical changes in interest rates over a twelve-month horizon.", "Interest rate swaps are placed to maintain exposure within approved thresholds and the Asset-Liability Committee reviews the re-pricing mismatch monthly.", "To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its pre-tax cash flow to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease of one percentage point in all interest rates across all maturities (a “parallel shift”), as well as a base case that assumes that all interest rates remain constant at existing levels.", "In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in Ford Credit’s analysis.", "As a result, the actual impact to pre-tax cash flow could be higher or lower than the results detailed in the table below.", "These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent Ford Credit’s view of future interest rate movements.", "Under these interest rate scenarios, Ford Credit expects more assets than debt and liabilities to re-price in the next twelve months.", "Other things being equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest received on Ford Credit’s assets will increase more than the interest paid on Ford Credit’s debt, thereby initially increasing Ford Credit’s pre-tax cash flow.", "During a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credit would expect its pre-tax cash flow to initially decrease.", "Ford Credit’s pre-tax cash flow sensitivity to interest rate movement at December 31 was as follows (in millions):", "One percentage point instantaneous increase in interest rates", "One percentage point instantaneous decrease in interest rates (a)", "(a) Pre-tax cash flow sensitivity given a one percentage point decrease in interest rates requires an assumption of negative interest rates in markets where existing interest rates are below one percent.", "While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credit’s best estimate of the impacts of the specified assumed interest rate scenarios, its actual results could differ from those projected.", "The model Ford Credit uses to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions.", "Embedded in the model are assumptions regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, replacement of maturing derivatives, exercise of options embedded in debt and derivatives, and predicted repayment of retail financing and operating lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity.", "Ford Credit’s repayment projections ahead of contractual maturity are based on historical experience.", "If interest rates or other factors change, Ford Credit’s actual prepayment experience could be different than projected.", "Item 7A.", "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued)", "Foreign Currency Risk.", "Ford Credit’s policy is to minimize exposure to changes in currency exchange rates.", "To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit borrows in a variety of currencies, principally U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, euros, sterling, and renminbi.", "Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables.", "When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements.", "When a different currency is used, Ford Credit may use foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards to convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables.", "As a result of this policy, Ford Credit believes its market risk exposure, relating to changes in currency exchange rates at December 31, 2022, is insignificant.", "Derivative Fair Values.", "The net fair value of Ford Credit’s derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2022 was a liability of $2.0 billion, compared to an asset of $553 million at December 31, 2021.", "The decline in net fair value was driven by higher U.S. interest rates and a stronger U.S. dollar.", "Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract.", "We enter into master agreements with counterparties that allow netting of certain exposures in order to manage this risk.", "Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, and commodity price risk.", "We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification.", "Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward-looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions before risks become losses.", "Exposure limits are established based on our overall risk tolerance, which is calculated from counterparty credit ratings and market-based credit default swap (“CDS”) spreads.", "The exposure limits are lower for smaller and lower-rated counterparties, counterparties that have relatively higher CDS spreads, and for longer dated exposures.", "Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and included in periodic reports to our Treasurer.", "Substantially all of

issued by the COSO.", "As discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for credit losses in 2020.", "The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.", "Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated

Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.", "We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.", "Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.", "Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.", "Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.", "Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as

of Internal Control over Financial Reporting", "A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial

includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.", "Because of its inherent

consumer allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of the lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the consumer finance receivables as of the balance sheet date.", "For consumer receivables that share similar risk characteristics, management estimates the lifetime expected credit losses based on a collective assessment using measurement models and management judgment.", "The lifetime expected credit losses for the receivables is determined by applying probability of default and loss given default assumptions to monthly expected exposures, then discounting these cash flows to present value using the receivable’s original effective interest rate or the current effective interest rate for a variable rate receivable.", "If management does not believe the models reflect lifetime expected credit losses for the portfolio, an adjustment is made to reflect management judgment regarding qualitative factors including economic uncertainty, observable changes in portfolio performance, and other relevant factors.", "The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Ford Credit consumer finance receivables allowance for credit losses is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in determining the consumer finance receivables allowance for credit losses; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the probability of default and loss given default assumptions and management’s judgment regarding qualitative factors; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.", "Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.", "These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s determination of the consumer finance receivables allowance for credit losses.", "These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for determining the consumer finance receivables allowance

service action obligations using a patterned estimation model, using historical information regarding the nature, frequency, severity, and average cost of claims for each model year.", "Management reevaluates the adequacy of their accruals on a regular basis.", "The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the warranty accrual for the United States is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in the estimation of the accrual and development of the patterned estimation model; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the estimation model and significant assumptions related to the frequency and average cost of claims; and (iii) the audit effort
