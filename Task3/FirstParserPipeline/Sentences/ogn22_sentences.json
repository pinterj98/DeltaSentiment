pharmaceutical formulations, processes for, or intermediates useful in, the manufacture of products, devices for delivering products, or the uses of products.", "Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the legal life of patents in the various countries, and may be extended in some jurisdictions based upon the period of time a patented product is under regulatory review by the relevant health authority.", "The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage.", "In particular, Organon considers the patents that cover the rod technology in Nexplanon to be material to Organon's business.", "Such device patents will expire in 2027 in the United States and in 2025

Implanon NXT that permits use of the underlying technology solely as a contraceptive implant containing only the active pharmaceutical ingredient currently used in the product.", "Additionally, in December 2021, Organon signed a supplemental license with Merck that provides a limited expansion of the fields in which it may use the underlying technology of Nexplanon / Implanon NXT beyond contraception in exchange for milestone payments.", "While the expiration of a product patent normally results in a loss of market exclusivity for the covered pharmaceutical product, commercial benefits may continue to be derived from: (i) later-granted patents on processes and intermediates related to the", "most economical method of manufacture of the active ingredient of such product; (ii) patents relating to the use or delivery of such product; (iii) patents relating to novel compositions and formulations; and (iv) in the United States and certain other countries, market or data exclusivity that may be available under relevant law.", "The effect of product patent expiration on pharmaceutical products also depends upon many other factors, such as the nature of the market and the position of the product in it, the growth of the market, the complexities and economics of the process for manufacture of the active ingredient of the product and the requirements of new drug provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or similar laws and regulations in other countries.", "Additions to market or data exclusivity are sought in the United States and other countries through all relevant laws, including laws increasing patent life.", "Some of the benefits of increases in patent life have been partially offset by an increase in the number of incentives for and use of generic products.", "Additionally, improvements in intellectual property laws are sought in the United States and other countries through reform of patent and other relevant laws and implementation

"Organon's competitors include other worldwide research-based pharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug manufacturers.", "Organon's operations may be adversely affected by generic and biosimilar competition as Organon's products mature, as well as technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, the generic availability of competitors' branded products and new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post-marketing surveillance.", "In addition, patent rights are increasingly being challenged by competitors and the outcome can be highly uncertain.", "An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products and could result in the payment of royalties or in the recognition of an impairment charge with respect to intangible assets associated with certain products.", "Competitive pressures have intensified as pressures in the industry have grown.", "To remain competitive, the additional resources required to meet market challenges include quality control, flexibility to meet buyer specifications, an efficient distribution system and a strong technical information service.", "Organon plans to acquire and market products through external alliances, such as licensing arrangements and collaborations, and has designed its sales and marketing efforts to address changing industry conditions.", "However, the introduction of new products and processes by competitors may result in price reductions and product displacements, even for products protected by patents.", "Global efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access.", "The United States enacted major health care reform legislation in 2010 in the form of the Affordable Care Act (the \"ACA\").", "The ACA, among other things, increased the mandated Medicaid drug rebate from 15.1% to 23.1%, expanded the rebate to Medicaid-managed care utilization, and increased the types of entities eligible for the federal 340B drug discount program.", "The ACA, together with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, also requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay 70% (up from 50% from the ACA effective 2019) of the negotiated price of the medicine, including biosimilar products, when Medicare Part D beneficiaries are in the Medicare Part D coverage gap (i.e., the so-called \"donut hole provision\").", "Under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \"IRA\"), this coverage gap will be eliminated beginning January 1, 2025.", "The IRA requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay 10% of the negotiated price of brands, biologics and biosimilar products, when Medicare Part D beneficiaries are in the initial coverage phase, and 20% of the negotiated price in the catastrophic phase of Medicare Part D coverage.", "Organon's cost-sharing responsibility for any approved product covered by Medicare Part D could be significantly greater under the newly designed Part D benefit structure compared to the pre-IRA benefit design.", "Organon recorded approximately $16 million, $17 million and $24 million as a reduction to revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to the coverage gap or \"donut hole\" provision.", "Furthermore, the IRA, among other reforms, allows Medicare to, beginning in 2026, establish a \"maximum fair price\" for certain high expenditure pharmaceutical and biological products covered under Medicare Parts B and D. Organon's products could be selected for negotiation and become subject to prices representing a significant discount from average prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers.", "The IRA also allows Medicare to, beginning in 2023, penalize drug companies that raise prices for products covered under Medicare Parts B and D faster than inflation through establishing a rebate obligation for those companies.", "The IRA also imposes on manufacturers that fail to comply with certain provisions of the IRA penalties, including civil monetary penalties.", "In addition, certain pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to pay an annual non-tax deductible branded prescription drug fee.", "The total annual industry fee was $2.8 billion in the years 2020 through 2022.", "The fee is assessed on each company in proportion to its share of prior year branded pharmaceutical sales to certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.", "Organon recorded approximately $3 million, $10

extension\" as ''a new formulation of the drug, but does not include an abuse-deterrent formulation of the drug[.]\"", "CMS adopted an expansive definition of \"new formulation\" to include ''a change to the drug, including, but not limited to: an extended release formulation or other change in release mechanism, a change in dosage form, strength, route of administration, or ingredients.\"", "This expanded definition may result in certain of Organon's drugs being subject to a higher Medicaid rebate liability.", "The new definitions of \"line extension\" and \"new formulation\" took effect on January 1, 2022.", "Finally, the provisions of this December 2020 Final Rule also may affect rebates owed under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program in certain circumstances where accumulator adjustment or similar programs are applied to Organon's drugs and the value of Organon's assistance programs, which is intended for patients, is not counted towards the patient's deductible or other out-of-pocket costs.", "In addition, other legislative changes include automatic 2% aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers, which results in an overall reduction in physician-administered drug reimbursement from 106% of Average Sales Price (\"ASP\") to approximately 104.3% of ASP.", "This change is part of the federal budget sequestration under the Budget Control Act of 2011, which went into effect in April 2013.", "The sequestration was temporarily halted from May 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022 as a result of various legislation, and later reduced to 1% from April 2022 to June 2022.", "The temporary suspension of the 2% reduction in Medicare payments to providers that was instituted in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic expired on July 1, 2022, with the 2% reduction set to remain in effect until 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken.", "Organon cannot predict how these and future adjustments to sequestration, and the way in which these laws impact physician reimbursement for Organon's products, will affect Organon's profitability.", "Organon also faces increasing pricing pressure globally from managed care organizations, government agencies and programs that could negatively affect Organon's sales and profit margins, including, in the United States (i) practices of managed care organizations, federal and state exchanges and institutional and governmental purchasers, and (ii) federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003

to be seen whether, and to what extent, the provisions of this Final Rule will take effect.", "While Organon cannot anticipate the effects of these changes on the way Organon currently contracts, the new framework could significantly alter the way Organon does business with Part D Plan Sponsors and PBMs on behalf of such plans.", "On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the IRA into law, which sets forth meaningful changes to drug product reimbursements by Medicare, which may reduce the prices Organon can charge and reimbursement Organon can receive for its products, among other effects.",

consider whether to select for testing by the CMS Innovation Center new health care payment and delivery models that would lower drug costs and promote access to innovative drug therapies for beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.", "The Executive Order further directed the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to submit, within 90 days after the date of the Executive Order, a report regarding any models that may lead to lower cost-sharing for commonly used drugs and support value-based payment that promotes high-quality care.", "At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing.", "Specifically, several U.S. states and localities have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports, and/or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials, and other activities.", "Other state laws prohibit certain marketing-related activities including the provision of gifts, meals or other items to certain healthcare providers, and restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs.", "In addition, several recently passed state laws require disclosures related to state agencies and/or commercial purchasers with respect to certain price increases that exceed a certain level as identified in the relevant statutes.", "Some of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements that government officials have not yet clarified.", "Given the lack of clarity in the laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations.", "In 2020, the FDA issued a final rule implementing provisions of Section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the \"FDCA\"), which allows the commercial importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada through FDA-authorized, time-limited programs sponsored by states or Indian tribes and, in certain future circumstances, pharmacists and wholesalers.", "At that time, the FDA also released a final guidance for industry detailing procedures for drug manufacturers to import FDA-approved prescription drug, biological, and combination products (approved under a New Drug Application (\"NDA\") or Biologics License Application (\"BLA\")) that were manufactured abroad and authorized and originally intended for sale in a foreign country.", "A trade organization brought suit, which remains pending in federal district court, challenging the commercial importation final rule.", "These changes could have a material adverse effect on Organon's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.", "In the United States private sector, consolidation and integration among health care providers is a major factor in the competitive marketplace for pharmaceutical products.", "Health plans and PBMs have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance.", "Private third-party insurers, as well as governments, employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion.", "Failure to obtain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for Organon's products or obtaining such placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely affect revenue.", "In addition to formulary tier co-pay or co-insurance differentials, private health insurance companies and self-insured employers have been raising co-payments and co-insurance required from beneficiaries, particularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products.", "Private health insurance companies are also increasingly imposing utilization management tools, such as clinical protocols requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine.", "These same management tools are also used in treatment areas in which the payor has taken the position that multiple branded", "products are therapeutically comparable.", "As the United States payor market concentrates further and as more drugs become available in generic form, pharmaceutical companies may face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payors.", "In addition, other proposals that allow international reference pricing or, under certain conditions, the importation of medicines from other countries may be considered.", "Pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products is not harmonized at the EU level, but rather controlled by individual EU Member States.", "In addition, a majority of countries in the EU attempt to contain drug costs by engaging in reference pricing in which authorities examine predetermined markets for published prices of drugs.", "Reference pricing may either compare a product's prices in other markets (external reference pricing) or compare a product's price with those of other products in a national class (internal reference pricing).", "The authorities then use the price data to set new local prices for brand-name drugs, including Organon's.", "Guidelines for examining reference pricing are usually set in local markets and can be changed pursuant to local regulations.", "Some EU Member States have established free-pricing systems, but regulate the pricing for drugs through profit control plans.", "Others seek to negotiate or set prices based on the cost-effectiveness of a product or an assessment of whether it offers a therapeutic benefit over other products in the relevant class.", "The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense.", "As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products.", "In some EU Member States, cross-border imports from low-priced markets also exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within an EU Member State.", "Additionally, EU Member States have the power to restrict the range of pharmaceutical products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement.", "In the EU, reimbursement plans vary widely from EU Member State to EU Member State.", "Some EU Member States provide that drug products may be marketed only after agreement on a reimbursement price.", "Some EU Member States may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to already available therapies, or socalled health technology assessments (\"HTA\"), to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval.", "The HTA of pharmaceutical products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in most EU Member States.", "The HTA process, which is governed by the national laws of these countries, involves the assessment of the cost-effectiveness, public health impact, therapeutic impact and/or the economic and social impact of use of a given pharmaceutical product in the national health care system of the individual country.", "Ultimately, HTA measures the added value of a new health technology compared to existing ones.", "The outcome of HTAs regarding specific pharmaceutical products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these pharmaceutical products by the regulatory authorities of individual EU Member States.", "A negative HTA of one of Organon's products may mean that the product is not reimbursable or may force Organon to reduce Organon's reimbursement price or offer discounts or rebates.", "A negative HTA by a leading and recognized HTA body could also undermine Organon's ability to obtain reimbursement for the relevant product outside a jurisdiction.", "For example, EU Member States that have not yet developed HTA mechanisms may rely to some extent on the HTA performed in other countries with a developed HTA framework to inform pricing and reimbursement decisions.", "HTA procedures require additional data, reviews and administrative processes, all of which increase the complexity, timing and costs of obtaining product reimbursement and exert downward pressure on available reimbursement.", "To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some EU Member States, Organon may be required to conduct studies that compare the costeffectiveness of Organon's product candidates to other therapies that are considered the local standard of care.", "There can be no assurance that any EU Member State will allow favorable pricing, reimbursement and market access conditions for any of Organon's products, or that it will be feasible to conduct additional cost-effectiveness studies, if required.", "In 2016, the UK held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as \"Brexit.\"", "As a result of that referendum and subsequent negotiations, the UK

years, and the importance of China to Organon's overall pharmaceutical business has increased accordingly.", "Continued growth of Organon's business in China is dependent upon ongoing development of a favorable environment for innovative pharmaceutical products, sustained access for Organon's current in-line products, and the absence of trade impediments or adverse pricing controls.", "In recent years, the Chinese government has introduced and implemented several structural reforms to accelerate the shift to innovative products and reduce costs.", "Since 2017, there have been multiple new policies introduced by the Chinese government to improve access to innovation, reduce the complexity of regulatory filings, and accelerate the review and approval process.", "This has led to a significant increase in the number of new products being approved each year.", "Additionally, in 2017, the Chinese government updated the National Reimbursement Drug List (\"NRDL\") for the first time in eight years.", "Since 2017, NRDL is being executed on an annual basis, which creates an access platform for innovative products.", "Though at the same time this regular innovative products access has been coupled with significant price reductions to ensure public access to NRDL and periodical-biannual price reviews for NRDL products.", "While pricing pressure has always existed in China, health care reform has increased this pressure in part due to the acceleration of generic substitution through volume-based procurement (\"VBP\").", "In 2019, the government implemented the VBP program through a tendering process for mature products that have generic substitutes with a Generic Quality Consistency Evaluation (\"GQCE\") approval.", "Mature products that have entered into the first seven rounds of VBP have had, on average, a price reduction of approximately 50%.", "Organon expects VBP to be a semi-annual process that will have a significant impact on mature products moving forward, which Organon expects to increase pricing pressure on its products in China.", "There are 300 molecules currently included under VBP, and it is expected that an aggregate of 500 molecules will be subject to VBP by 2025.", "Organon's focus on other markets has continued.", "Governments in many other markets are also focused on constraining health care costs and have enacted price controls and measures impacting intellectual property, including in exceptional cases, threats of compulsory licenses that aim to put pressure on the price of innovative pharmaceuticals or result in constrained market access to innovative medicine.", "Organon anticipates that pricing pressures and market access challenges will continue in the future to varying degrees in such markets.", "Beyond pricing and market access challenges, other conditions in certain countries outside the United States can affect Organon's efforts to continue to grow in these markets, including potential political instability, changes in trade sanctions and embargoes, significant currency fluctuation and controls, financial crises, limited or changing availability of funding for health care, credit worthiness of health care partners such as hospitals due to COVID-19, and other developments that may adversely impact the business environment for Organon.", "Further, Organon may engage third-party agents to assist in operating in such markets, which may affect Organon's ability to realize continued growth and may also increase Organon's risk exposure.", "In addressing cost containment pressures, Organon engages in public policy advocacy with policymakers and continues to work to demonstrate that its medicines provide value to patients and to those who pay for health care.", "Organon advocates with government policymakers to encourage a long-term approach to sustainable health care financing that ensures access to innovative medicines and does not disproportionately target pharmaceuticals as a source of budget savings.", "In markets with historically low rates of health care spending, Organon encourages those governments to increase their investments and adopt market reforms to improve their citizens' access to appropriate health care, including medicines.", "The pharmaceutical and medical device industries are also subject to regulation by regional, country, state and local

the FDA in the United States, which administers requirements covering the testing, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals and medical devices.", "In some cases, the FDA requirements and practices have increased the amount of time and resources necessary to develop new products and bring them to market in the United States.", "At the same time, the FDA has committed to expediting the development and review of products bearing the ''breakthrough therapy\" designation, and established other expedited programs to support the development, review, and approval of medicines where there is unmet medical need in serious and life-threatening conditions.", "The FDA has also undertaken efforts to bring generic and biosimilar

and most foreign countries provide for the determination of effectiveness and safety of new chemical compounds suitable for pharmaceutical use through pre-clinical tests and controlled clinical evaluation.", "Before a new drug may be marketed in the United States, recorded data on pre-clinical and clinical investigations are included in the NDA for a drug or the Biologics License Application (\"BLA\") for a biologic, and submitted to the FDA for the required approval.", "Once scientists identify internal technology development opportunities or external technology licensing opportunities to enable improvement of existing products or development of new products, pre-clinical testing with that compound is commenced.", "Pre-clinical testing includes laboratory testing and safety studies in animals to gather data on chemistry, pharmacology, immunogenicity, and toxicology, and must be conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice regulations.", "Pending acceptable pre-clinical data, Organon will submit an Investigational New Drug (\"IND\") application to the FDA through a combination of internal and external resources, which includes the results of pre-clinical testing, information about the drug composition and manufacturing, and Organon's plan for clinical testing on humans.", "After submission of the IND, Organon must wait 30 days before initiating clinical testing so that the FDA can review the IND and determine that clinical testing will not expose human subjects to unreasonable risk.", "The FDA may impose a full or partial hold on an IND before or after it goes into effect, requiring that Organon halt clinical testing in accordance with the hold.", "Once an IND goes into effect, Organon will then initiate clinical testing under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with established regulatory requirements, including Good Clinical Practice regulations.", "The clinical testing typically begins with Phase 1 studies, which are designed to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary pharmacodynamic activity of the compound in humans.", "If favorable, additional, larger Phase 2 studies are initiated to determine evidence of the efficacy of the compound in the affected population and define appropriate dosing for the compound, as well as identify any adverse effects that could limit the compound's usefulness.", "In some situations, the clinical program incorporates adaptive design methodology to use accumulating data to decide how to modify aspects of the ongoing clinical study as it continues without undermining the validity and integrity of the trial.", "One type of adaptive clinical trial is an adaptive Phase 2a / 2b trial design, a two-stage trial design consisting of a Phase 2a proof-of-concept stage and a Phase 2b dose-optimization finding stage.", "If data from the Phase 2 trials are satisfactory, Organon commences large-scale Phase 3 trials to confirm the compound's efficacy and safety.", "Another type of adaptive clinical trial is an adaptive Phase 2 / 3 trial design, a study that can include an interim analysis and an adaptation that changes the trial from having features common in a Phase 2 study (such as multiple dose groups) to a design similar to a Phase 3 trial.", "An adaptive Phase 2 / 3 trial design can reduce timelines by eliminating activities which would be required to start a separate study.", "Upon completion of Phase 3 trials, if satisfactory, Organon submits regulatory filings with the appropriate regulatory agencies around the world to have the product candidate approved for marketing.", "There can be no assurance that a compound that is the result of any particular program will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for it to be marketed.", "After a product receives", "marketing authorization, the FDA may require Organon to perform post-marketing studies, or Phase 4 studies, which may involve additional clinical trials, nonclinical testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products or to provide additional information regarding treatment or a drug's risks, benefits, or best use.", "In the United States, upon completion of clinical testing, a complete NDA or BLA is submitted to the FDA.", "Within 60 days after receipt, the FDA determines if the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, or instead if the FDA will issue a refuse to file determination.", "The FDA also assesses, at that time, whether the application will be granted a priority review or standard review.", "Pursuant to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA review period target for NDAs or original BLAs is either six months for priority review or 10 months for a standard review from the time the application is deemed sufficiently complete.", "An additional two months is added to these timelines for new molecular entities.", "Once the review timelines are determined, the FDA will generally act upon the application within those timelines, unless a major amendment has been submitted (either at Organon's own initiative or the FDA's request) to the pending application.", "If this occurs, the FDA may extend the review period to allow for review of the new information, but by no more than three months.", "These timelines are not binding, and the FDA may not meet them in particular cases.", "The FDA can act on an application either by issuing an approval letter or by issuing a Complete Response Letter (\"CRL\") stating that the application will not be approved in its present form and describing all deficiencies that the FDA has identified.", "Should Organon wish to pursue an application after receiving a CRL, absent an appeal, Organon is able to resubmit the application with information that addresses the questions or issues identified by the FDA to support approval.", "Resubmissions are subject to review period targets, which vary depending on the underlying submission type and the content of the resubmission.", "The FDA has four primary program designations—Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Accelerated Approval and Priority Review—to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical need in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions.", "The Fast Track designation provides pharmaceutical manufacturers with opportunities for frequent interactions with FDA reviewers during the product's development and the ability for the manufacturer to do a rolling submission of the NDA/BLA.", "A rolling submission allows completed portions of the application to be submitted and reviewed by the FDA on an ongoing basis.", "The Breakthrough Therapy designation provides manufacturers with the same features of the Fast Track designation as well as intensive guidance on implementing an efficient development program for the product and a commitment by the FDA to involve senior managers and experienced staff in the review.", "The Accelerated Approval designation allows the FDA to approve a product based on an effect on a surrogate or intermediate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a product's clinical benefit and generally requires the manufacturer to conduct required post-approval confirmatory trials to verify the clinical benefit.", "As a condition of approval, the FDA will require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform Phase 4 or postmarketing studies to verify and describe the predicted clinical benefit, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.", "The Priority Review designation means that the FDA's goal is to take action on the NDA/BLA within six months compared to 10 months under standard review, with two months added to these periods for new molecular entities.", "In addition, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act provides for an abbreviated pathway for obtaining FDA approval of biologic drugs that satisfy certain criteria.", "If a manufacturer can show that its proposed biosimilar product is highly similar to and has no clinically meaningful differences from the FDA-approved reference product, it can rely in part on the FDA's previous determination of safety and effectiveness for the reference product for obtaining approval.", "This can potentially lead to a faster and less costly approval process for these products because it generally means that the biosimilar manufacturer does not need to conduct as many clinical trials.", "After the NDA or BLA has been approved, a drug can be marketed in the United States and remains subject to post-marketing drug safety monitoring requirements.", "Any significant changes to an approved drug, such as changes in formulation, labeling, dosage strength, or certain manufacturing changes, require approval by the FDA through a supplemental application, and for certain significant categories of changes, prior approval by the FDA.", "Additionally, further development of an approved drug for a new use, dosage strength, or a new or different form must be conducted under a new IND.", "Organon's activities after approval are subject to the FDA's requirements governing, among other things, drug establishment registration and listing, labeling and advertising, and current Good Manufacturing Practices (\"cGMP\") regulations, which set forth minimum requirements for the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing, and packing of a drug product.", "Post-approval reports of product quality defects and adverse events are maintained and submitted to the FDA in accordance with its regulations.", "The FDA conducts routine inspections of drug manufacturing facilities to monitor compliance with these requirements.", "Noncompliance with cGMP or other regulatory requirements can lead to regulatory action, including issuance of Warning Letters to Organon or issuance of safety alerts, press releases, or other communications containing warnings about the products; suspension or withdrawal of the marketing authorizations; suspension of any ongoing clinical trials; or other enforcement or regulatory actions, including seeking injunction or imposing civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines.", "The FDA regulates the advertising and promotion of Organon's products to ensure that the claims Organon makes are consistent with its regulatory approvals, that there are adequate and reasonable data to substantiate the claims, and that Organon's promotional labeling and advertising are neither false nor misleading in any respect.", "As a manufacturer and distributor of drug products, Organon's activities are regulated under various federal and state statutes, including the Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 (the \"DQSA\") and state manufacturer and wholesaler laws.", "Title II of the DQSA, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, calls for the establishment of a nationwide electronic system that tracks certain prescription drugs at each point in the supply chain to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated, or mislabeled drugs into the market.", "Implementation began in 2015 and is scheduled to be completed by late 2023.", "The FDA has issued regulations and guidance implementing the DQSA, which require manufacturers, distributors, and dispensers to comply with various regulatory requirements related to product identification, product tracing, product verification, detection and response, notification, and wholesaler licensing.", "Under the Controlled Substances Act (the \"CSA\"), manufacturers and distributors of controlled substances must maintain registration with the Drug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\"), and comply with various regulatory requirements, including maintaining records and inventory, reporting to the DEA, and meeting certain security and operational safeguards.", "Similar requirements exist in most states.", "The FDA's laws and regulations that govern medical devices include requirements for the design, development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, clinical trials, and pre-market clearance and approval, among other requirements.", "Medical devices are classified into three classes based on their risk: Class I devices present the least risk; Class II devices present moderate risk; and Class III devices are the highest risk.", "The regulatory controls and requirements vary by the class of device.", "All classes of devices are subject to \"general controls,\" which include: establishment registration and device listing, compliance with the design controls and good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System Regulation, medical device reporting, reporting of recalls, corrections and removals, and labeling and promotional requirements.", "Most Class I devices do not require any review by the FDA prior to marketing.", "Most Class II devices require the submission of a pre-market notification under section 510(k) of the FDCA prior to marketing.", "Class II devices are also subject to \"special controls,\" which are unique controls the FDA establishes for each device type, typically in the form of a guidance document that specifies requirements such as performance testing and labeling.", "Class III devices require FDA approval of a pre-market approval application (\"PMA\") prior to marketing and are subject to conditions of approval (which may include post-market study requirements or restrictions on the sale and distribution of the device).", "Devices that have not previously been classified are automatically Class III.", "However, if the device is low- or moderate-risk, the manufacturer can submit a de novo classification request asking the FDA to classify the device into Class I or Class II and authorize the marketing of the device.", "A 510(k) pre-market notification must demonstrate that the proposed device is \"substantially equivalent\" to a predicate device already on the market.", "Substantial equivalence means that the proposed device: (1) has the same intended use as the predicate device; and (2) either (a) has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device, or (b) has different technological characteristics, but does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device and data demonstrate the proposed device is as safe and effective as the predicate device.", "If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device.", "If the FDA determines that the device is not \"substantially equivalent\" to a previously cleared device, or if the FDA has not classified the device, the device is automatically a Class III device.", "The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a classification into Class I or II via a de novo classification request.", "A de novo classification request must describe the risks and benefits of the device and demonstrate that general controls (for a Class I device) or general and special controls (for a Class II device) provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.", "In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data.", "Clinical trials are almost always required to support PMAs and are sometimes required to support 510(k) pre-market notifications.", "Such clinical testing must be conducted in compliance with the FDA's investigational device exemption (\"IDE\") regulations and additional regulations pertaining to human research.", "If the device is a \"significant risk\" device, clinical trial sponsors must obtain the FDA's approval of an IDE application prior to commencing the study.", "IDE approval is not required for non-significant risk device studies.", "All device clinical trials are subject to additional requirements, including obtaining informed consent from study subjects and approval by institutional review boards, monitoring, record-keeping, reporting and submitting information regarding certain clinical trials to a public database maintained by the National Institutes of Health.", "Once a device has obtained FDA clearance or approval, certain modifications will require further pre-market review before they can be implemented.", "For 510(k)-cleared devices (or Class II devices authorized through the de novo classification pathway), any change that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device or that involves a major change to the device's intended use requires clearance of a new 510(k) pre-market notification.", "Manufacturers are responsible for determining whether a modification meets this standard, and for any changes the company determines do not require a 510(k), the rationale and information supporting the determination must be documented.", "For PMA approved devices, major changes (i.e., those affecting safety or effectiveness) require FDA approval of a PMA supplement.", "Certain other changes, including some labelling changes and some manufacturing changes, may be implemented with prior notice to the FDA.", "Other changes may be reported in periodic reports.", "Marketed devices are also subject to ongoing FDA regulation.", "Requirements include those related to establishment registration and device listing, labeling and advertising, unique device identification, and good manufacturing practice and design controls.", "Device manufacturers are also subject to the FDA's medical device reporting regulations, which require a manufacturer to report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur.", "Manufacturer's must also comply with FDA's correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA corrections or removals undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health.", "The FDA conducts routine inspections of device manufacturing facilities to monitor compliance with these requirements.", "Non-compliance can lead to informal or formal enforcement action, including Untitled Letters, Warning Letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, civil penalties, recalls, detention or seizure of Organon's products, import refusals, and criminal prosecution.", "Although physicians are permitted to use their medical judgment to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA, Organon may not promote its products for such \"off-label\" uses and can only market its products for cleared or approved uses.", "Both the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission have authority over aspects of medical device promotion and prohibit false or misleading labeling and advertising.", "Other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities can also take action under other laws and regulations, such as false claims laws, if they consider Organon's business activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, and exclusion from participation in government health care programs.", "The Regulatory Approval Process Outside the United States", "Before Organon's pharmaceutical products can be marketed outside the United States, they may be subject to regulatory approval similar to that required in the United States.", "The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, including requirements to conduct additional clinical trials, product licensing, safety reporting, post-authorization requirements, marketing and promotion, interactions with health care professionals, pricing and reimbursement, may vary widely from country to country.", "No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate approval application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country.", "The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval.", "In certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved.", "The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted.", "Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices may not be approved for such product, which would make launch of such products commercially unfeasible in such countries.", "There are also regulations setting out requirements for medical devices in jurisdictions outside the United States.", "These regulations set out requirements for placing devices on the market, investigations/trials, safety reporting, marketing and promotion.", "The following section sets out an overview of the regulatory framework for medicinal products and medical devices in the EU.", "These rules also apply in the additional Member States of the European Economic Area (\"EEA\"), namely Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.", "Like the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls.", "Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC (\"Clinical Trials Directive\") sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework by setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU,", "EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Clinical Trials Directive in a manner that is not always uniform.", "This has led to variations in the rules governing the conduct of clinical trials in the individual EU Member States.", "Therefore, the EU has adopted Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 (\"Clinical Trials Regulation\") as of January 31, 2022.", "Under this new Clinical Trials Regulation, the approval of clinical trials in the EU has been simplified and streamlined.", "For example, the sponsor submits a single application for approval of a clinical trial via the clinical trials information system.", "As part of the application process, the sponsor proposes a reporting EU Member State, which coordinates the validation and evaluation of the application.", "The reporting EU Member State consults and coordinates with the other concerned EU Member States.", "If an application is rejected, it can be amended and resubmitted through the EU Portal.", "If an approval is issued, the sponsor can start the clinical trial in all concerned EU Member States.", "However, a concerned EU Member State can in limited circumstances declare an \"opt-out\" from an approval.", "In such a case, the clinical trial cannot be conducted in that EU Member State.", "The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting, and introduces enhanced transparency requirements such as mandatory submission of a summary of the clinical trial results to the EU Database.", "National laws, regulations, and the applicable Good Clinical Practice and Good Laboratory Practice standards must also be respected during the conduct of the trials, including the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (\"GCP\").", "During the development of a pharmaceutical product, the EMA and national regulators within the EU provide the opportunity for dialogue and guidance on the development program.", "At the EMA level, this is usually done in the form of scientific advice, which is given by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (\"CHMP\") on the recommendation of the Scientific Advice Working Party.", "A fee is incurred with each scientific advice procedure.", "Advice from the EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical studies, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs.", "Advice is not legally binding for any future Marketing Authorization Application (\"MAA\") of the product concerned.", "In the EU, the Pediatric Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 (\"Pediatric Regulation\") sets out the requirements for testing medicinal products in pediatric populations.", "In most EU Member States, companies are also required to have an approved Pediatric Investigation Plan before enrolling pediatric patients in a clinical trial.", "In the EU, pharmaceutical products may only be placed on the market after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (\"MA\").", "MAs can be obtained through the centralized procedure, the mutual recognition procedure, the decentralized procedure, or a national procedure (the latter is available only for pharmaceutical products sold in a single EU Member State only).", "The primary method Organon uses to obtain a MA of pharmaceutical products in the EU is through the centralized procedure.", "The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single MA by the European Commission (\"EC\"), which is valid for all EU Member States (and, after respective national implementing decisions, in the three additional EEA Member States).", "The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical products, including pharmaceutical products derived from biotechnological processes, orphan pharmaceutical products, advanced therapy pharmaceutical products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases.", "Under the centralized procedure, the timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA's CHMP is, in principle, 210 days from receipt of a valid MAA.", "However, this timeline excludes clock stops, which occur when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP, so the overall process typically takes a year or more.", "Applications may be eligible for accelerated assessment if the CHMP decides the product is of major interest for public health and therapeutic innovation.", "On request, the CHMP can reduce the time frame to 150 days if the applicant provides sufficient justification for an accelerated assessment.", "The CHMP will provide a positive opinion regarding the application only if it meets certain quality, safety and efficacy requirements.", "However, the EC has final authority for granting the MA, and it must issue the decision within 67 days after receipt of the CHMP opinion.", "Following the UK's exit from the EU on January 1, 2021, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (\"MHRA\") converted centralized MAs into UK MAs that apply in Great Britain (as under the Northern Irish Protocol the EU centralized MAs continue to apply in Northern Ireland).", "MA holders of the centralized MAs had the right to opt-out of the conversion until January 21, 2021; however, this would mean that these products would not be licensed to be marketed in Great Britain.", "For those with converted MAs, the holder of these MAs had to submit baseline data to the MHRA and pay the national", "MA fee.", "For EU MAs that were granted after January 1, 2021, these MAs will not be automatically converted into UK MAs.", "However, the MHRA offer some streamlined routes for authorization.", "For example, for three years from January 1, 2021 the MHRA may rely on the decision of the EC on the approval of a new centralized MA when granted an MA that applies in Great Britain.", "If the centralized procedure is not used, then applicants can obtain national marketing authorizations.", "This can be if a pharmaceutical product falls under the optional scope of the centralized procedure and the applicant opts to use a national (decentralized / mutual recognition) procedure or if the centralized procedure would not apply.", "The purely national marketing authorization procedure permits a company to apply to the competent authority of a single EU Member State and, if successful, to obtain a MA that is valid only in this EU Member State.", "However, if the applicant wants a MA in several EU Member States it must use the decentralized or mutual recognition procedure (as applicable) to obtain a suite of national MAs.", "The decentralized marketing authorization procedure permits companies to file identical applications for an MA to the competent authorities in several EU Member States simultaneously for a pharmaceutical product that has not yet been authorized in any EU Member State.", "This procedure is available for pharmaceutical products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.", "The competent authority of a single EU Member State, the reference EU Member State, is appointed to review the application and provide an assessment report.", "The competent authorities of the other EU Member States, the concerned EU Member States, are subsequently required to grant MA for their territories based on this assessment.", "The only exception to this is where the competent authority of an EU Member State considers that there are concerns of potential serious risk to public health related to authorization of the product.", "In these circumstances the matter is submitted to the Coordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralized Procedures - Human for review.", "Where a pharmaceutical product has already been authorized for marketing in an EU Member State, this national authorization can be recognized in another EU Member State through the mutual recognition procedure.", "The EU Member State that has already granted a MA is the reference EU Member State.", "The holder of the MA then asks the reference EU Member State to either prepare or update an assessment report.", "As with the decentralized procedure, the assessment report is shared with the concerned EU Member States.", "These EU Member States must grant the MA unless the exception (on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health) applies.", "Similar to accelerated approval regulations in the United States, conditional MAs can be granted in the EU by the EC in exceptional circumstances.", "A conditional MA can be granted for pharmaceutical products where, although comprehensive clinical data referring to the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product have not been supplied, a number of criteria are fulfilled: (i) the benefit / risk balance of the product is positive, (ii) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the comprehensive clinical data post-authorization, (iii) an unmet medical need will be fulfilled by the grant of the marketing authorization and (iv) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the pharmaceutical product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.", "A conditional MA must be renewed annually until it is eventually converted into a standard MA when the holder fulfills any obligations imposed and the data supports that the benefits outweigh its risks.", "Alternatively, where the applicant can show it is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions (because the condition is too rare, it would be impossible given the current state of scientific knowledge and/or it would be contrary to medical ethics), the EC may grant an MA in exceptional circumstances.", "MAs granted under exceptional circumstances will be reviewed annually to ensure the benefits continue to outweigh the risks.", "However, they will usually not result in a normal MA as the data to support its granting will never be generated.", "All new MAAs must include a Risk Management Plan (\"RMP\") describing the risk management system that Organon will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product.", "The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA.", "RMPs and Periodic Safety Update Reports (\"PSURs\") are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions.", "Normal MAs (i.e., not including Conditional MAs and those granted under exceptional circumstances) have an initial duration of five years.", "After these five years, the authorization may be renewed on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance.", "Once renewed, the MA is valid for an unlimited period unless the EC or the national competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal.", "Applications for renewal must be made to the EMA at least nine months before the five-year period expires.", "As in the United States, it may be possible to obtain a period of market and / or data exclusivity in the EU that would have the effect of postponing the entry into the marketplace of a competitor's generic, hybrid or biosimilar product (in the case of marketing exclusivity, even if the pharmaceutical product has already received an MA) and for data exclusivity, prohibiting another applicant from relying on the MA holder's pharmacological, toxicological and clinical data in support of another MA for the purposes of submitting an application.", "New medicinal products authorized in the EU on the basis of a standalone application (i.e., on the basis of a dossier containing a complete suite of pre-clinical tests and clinical trials) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and 10 years of marketing exclusivity.", "An additional noncumulative one-year period of marketing exclusivity is possible if during the data exclusivity period (the first eight years of the 10-year marketing exclusivity period), the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that are deemed to bring a significant clinical benefit compared to existing therapies.", "This product is referred to as the \"reference medicinal product.\"", "The data exclusivity period begins on the date of the reference medicinal product's first MA in the EU.", "After eight years, a generic product application may be submitted and generic companies may rely on the data in the reference medicinal product's dossier.", "However, a generic product cannot launch until two (or three, if the reference medicinal product was authorized for an additional indication) years later (or a total of 10 or 11 years after the first MA in the EU of the reference medicinal product).", "Another noncumulative one-year period of data exclusivity can be obtained where an application is made for a new indication for a wellestablished substance, provided that significant pre-clinical or clinical studies were carried out in relation to the new indication.", "One year of data exclusivity is also available for data generated where a change of classification (i.e., from prescription-only to over the counter) of a pharmaceutical product has been authorized on the basis of significant pre-trial tests or clinical trials.", "However, this data exclusivity only protects the new switch data (i.e., when examining an application by another applicant for or holder of market authorization for a change of classification of the same substance, a competent authority will not refer to the results of those tests or trials for one year).", "However, data and market exclusivity are not monopoly rights.", "Therefore, another company could also market another version of the pharmaceutical product if such company can complete a full MAA with their own complete database of pharmaceutical tests, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials (without relying on the other initial applicant's data) and obtain MA of its product.", "Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the EC and / or the national competent authorities of the EU Member States.", "This oversight applies both before and after grant of manufacturing licenses and marketing authorizations.", "It includes control of compliance with EU good manufacturing practices rules, manufacturing authorizations, pharmacovigilance rules and requirements governing advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, recordkeeping, importing and exporting of pharmaceutical products.", "Failure by Organon or by any of its third-party partners, including suppliers, manufacturers and distributors, to comply with EU laws and the related national laws of individual EU Member States governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, marketing authorization of pharmaceutical products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of marketing authorization, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or other applicable regulatory requirements, may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties.", "These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials or to grant marketing authorization, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the marketing authorization, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.", "The holder of an MA for a pharmaceutical product in the EU must also comply with EU pharmacovigilance legislation and its related regulations and guidelines, which entail many requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of pharmaceutical products.", "These pharmacovigilance rules can impose on holders of MAs the obligation to conduct a labor intensive collection of data regarding the risks and benefits of marketed pharmaceutical products and to engage in ongoing assessments of those risks and benefits, including the possible requirement to conduct additional clinical studies or post-authorization safety studies to obtain further information on a medicine's safety, or to measure the effectiveness of risk-management measures, which may be time consuming, expensive and could impact Organon's profitability.", "MA holders must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system.", "The EMA reviews PSURs for pharmaceutical products authorized through the centralized procedure.", "If the EMA has concerns that the risk benefit profile of a product has varied, it", "can adopt an opinion advising that the existing MA for the product be suspended, withdrawn or varied.", "The agency can advise that the MA holder be obliged to conduct post-authorization Phase IV safety studies.", "The EMA opinion is submitted to the EC for its consideration.", "If the European Commission agrees with the opinion, it can adopt a decision varying the existing MA.", "Failure by the marketing authorization holder to fulfill the obligations in the EC's decision can undermine the on-going validity of the MA.", "More generally, noncompliance with pharmacovigilance obligations can lead to the variation, suspension or withdrawal of the MA for the product or imposition of financial penalties or other enforcement measures.", "The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products in the EU is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations.", "Manufacturing requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive (EU) 2017/1572, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice (\"GMP\").", "Organon and its third-party manufacturers are

these practices.", "These include suspension of manufacturing authorization in case of non-compliance with the EU or EU Member States' requirements governing the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products.", "Compliance with EU GMP standards is required when manufacturing pharmaceutical products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside the EU with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU.", "The manufacturer or importer must have a qualified person who is responsible for certifying that each batch of product has been manufactured in accordance with GMP before releasing the product for commercial distribution in the EU or for use in a clinical trial.", "Manufacturing

condition.", "•       Organon faces continued pricing pressure with respect to its products.", "•       Organon faces intense competition from competitors' products.", "•       Organon has limited in-house discovery and early research capabilities and will continue to rely on future acquisitions, partnerships and collaborations to expand its innovative pipeline and early discovery and research capabilities, which may limit its ability to discover or develop new products or expand its existing products into new markets to replace the sales of products that lose patent protection and therefore Organon may not be able to maintain its current levels of profitability.", "•       Organon may experience difficulties identifying acquisition opportunities or completing such

technology services, research and development, distribution, support for operations, legal, payroll, finance, tax and accounting, general administrative services and other support services.", "Organon's historical financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from Merck for these and similar functions that may be less than the comparable expenses Organon would have incurred had it operated as a separate publicly traded company.", "Prior to the spinoff, Organon shared economies of scope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and relationships with its partners.", "While Organon has entered into transition agreements that govern certain commercial and other relationships between it and Merck, those arrangements may not capture the benefits to Organon's business that resulted from being integrated with the other affiliates of Merck.", "Key products generate a significant amount of Organon's profits and cash flows, and any events that adversely affect the markets for Organon's leading products could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.", "Organon's ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely upon the continued profitability of its key products, such as Nexplanon, Cozaar/Hyzaar, Singulair and the Ezetimibe family of products.", "As a result of Organon's dependence on key products, any event that adversely affects any of these products or the markets for any of these products could adversely affect Organon's sales, results of operations or cash flows.", "These adverse events could include increased costs associated with manufacturing, product shortages, increased generic or over-the-counter availability of Organon's products or competitive products, the discovery of previously unknown side effects, results of post-approval trials, increased competition from the introduction of new, more effective treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of these products for any reason.", "Organon also expects that competition will continue to adversely affect the sales of these products.", "Organon faces continued pricing pressure with respect to its products.", "Organon faces continued pricing pressure globally and, particularly in mature markets from managed care organizations, government agencies and programs that could adversely affect its sales and profit margins.", "Organon expects pricing pressure to continue in the future.", "For example, in the United States, Organon experiences significant pricing pressure from: managed care groups, institutional and governmental purchasers, U.S. federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid (including the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, the ACA, and the IRA), and state laws aimed at regulating prices, securing higher rebates, and increasing price transparency).", "Current and past administrations have listed drug pricing as a health care reform priority.", "For example, former President Trump used several means, including federal budget proposals, executive orders, and policy initiatives, to propose or implement drug pricing reform; on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug's average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024; and on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the IRA into law, which sets forth meaningful changes to drug product reimbursement by Medicare.", "As discussed in the section entitled \"Business - Competition and the Health Care Environment\", the IRA, among other things, requires manufacturers to pay 10% of the negotiated price of brands, biologics and biosimilar products, when Medicare Part D beneficiaries are in the initial coverage phase, and 20% of the negotiated price in the catastrophic phase of Medicare Part D coverage; establishes a \"maximum fair price\" beginning in 2026 for certain high expenditure pharmaceutical and biological products covered under Medicare Parts B and D; and allows Medicare to, beginning in 2023, penalize drug companies that raise prices for products covered under Medicare Parts B and D faster than inflation through establishing a rebate obligation for those companies.", "Changes to the health care system enacted as part of health care reform in the United States, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, could result in further pricing pressures.", "In addition, in the United States, larger customers have received higher rebates on drugs in certain highly competitive categories.", "Organon must also compete to be placed on formularies of managed care organizations and other payors.", "Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to reduced usage in the population covered by the managed care organization or other payor.", "Outside the United States, numerous major markets, including the EU, the UK, China and Japan, have pervasive government involvement in health care funding and, in that regard, extensive pricing and reimbursement mechanisms and processes for pharmaceutical products.", "Consequently, in those markets, Organon is subject to government decision-making and budgetary actions with respect to its products.", "For instance, pricing pressure from the Chinese government has recently increased, including through a series of health care reforms to accelerate generic substitution through the government's VBP and GQCE programs.", "In 2019, the Chinese government implemented the VBP program through a tendering process for mature products that have generic substitutes with a \"GQCE\" approval process.", "Mature products that have entered into the first seven rounds of VBP have had, on average, a price reduction of approximately 50%.", "Organon expects VBP to be a semi-annual process that will have a significant impact on mature products moving forward.", "There are 300 molecules currently included under VBP, and it is expected that an aggregate of 500 molecules will be subject to VBP by 2025.", "After the expiration of the national VBP period, individual provinces may implement their own provincial-level VBP programs.", "In addition, the Universal Reimbursement Payment Standard (\"URPS\") program is currently being piloted in multiple Chinese provinces.", "Under the URPS, the government will usually determine the reimbursement prices by referring to the prices of the lowest-priced VBP winning products, with any remaining costs are then passed along to the patients in the form of a co-pay, which reduces the affordability of certain products with prices that exceed the lowest-priced VBP- winning products.", "The URPS policy will create additional pricing and volume pressure for pharmaceutical products that are subject to the program and may adversely affect Organon's business and results of operations.", "In Japan, the pharmaceutical industry is subject to government-mandated biennial price reductions of pharmaceutical products.", "Furthermore, the government can order re-pricing for specific products if it determines that use of such product will exceed certain thresholds defined under applicable re-pricing rules.", "Organon's products face intense competition from competitors' products, including lower cost generic versions of its products that have lost market exclusivity.", "Competitors' products may be equally safe and as effective as Organon's products but sold at a substantially lower price than Organon's products.", "Alternatively, Organon's competitors' products may be safer or more effective, more convenient to use, have better insurance coverage or reimbursement levels or be more effectively marketed and sold than Organon's products.", "Organon's efforts to compete with other companies or Organon's failure to maintain its competitive position could adversely affect its business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.", "Organon has limited in-house discovery and early research capabilities and will continue to rely on future acquisitions, partnerships and collaborations to expand its innovative pipeline and early discovery and research capabilities, which may limit its ability to discover or develop new products or expand its existing products into new markets to replace the sales of products that lose patent protection, and therefore Organon may not be able to maintain its current levels of profitability.", "Organon has limited in-house discovery and early research staff and facilities, and does not currently intend to extensively hire or acquire such staff or facilities in the near future.", "Instead, Organon intends to continue to rely on future acquisitions, partnerships and collaborations with third parties to expand its innovative pipeline, existing portfolio and innovation and early research capabilities.", "Organon intends to grow its business through new indications or formulations of its existing products or expansion of existing products into new markets or new geographies.", "However, Organon expects that its ability to do so could be limited by the scope of its limited intellectual property licenses for certain women's health products.", "For example, a license from Merck for Nexplanon permits use of the underlying technology solely as a contraceptive implant containing only the active pharmaceutical ingredient currently used in the product.", "Additionally, in December 2021, Organon signed a supplemental license with Merck that provides a limited expansion of the fields in which Organon may use the underlying technology of Nexplanon beyond contraception in exchange for milestone payments.", "Organon may not be able to offset any sales losses for products that lose or do not have exclusivity by growing sales in other markets.", "If Organon cannot produce sufficient revenues from expansion into new products, new indications or formulations of its existing products or expansion of existing products into new markets or new geographies, then Organon may not be able to maintain its current levels of profitability, and this could adversely affect Organon's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.", "Organon relies on third parties for activities related to preclinical and clinical testing.", "Organon relies on third parties to manufacture and distribute its products for preclinical and clinical testing and to conduct certain preclinical and clinical testing activities.", "Oversight of these third parties can require substantial resources and creates potential risks to Organon, including: Organon may be unable to establish agreements with third parties, including third party manufacturers, on acceptable terms or even at all; Organon may not have sufficient quantities of product; third parties may fail to comply with regulatory requirements; or third parties may misappropriate or disclose our proprietary information, including trade secrets and know-how.", "Organon's reliance on third parties for research and development activities will also reduce Organon's control over these activities but does not relieve Organon of its responsibilities, including that Organon must ensure that clinical trials are conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial; ensure compliance with regulatory standards like good clinical practices; and register ongoing clinical trials and results to government-", "sponsored databases.", "Organon's failures, or the failure of third parties, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on Organon, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocations, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions.", "Further, issues related to manufacture of product, preclinical testing, and/or clinical testing may affect Organon's ability to obtain or maintain marketing approval for its products in a timely manner, or at all.", "This may hinder or delay efforts to successfully commercialize Organon's product candidates.", "Organon may experience difficulties identifying acquisition opportunities or completing such transactions.", "Organon intends to continue pursuing acquisitions of complementary businesses, licensing arrangements and strategic partnerships to expand its product offerings and geographic presence as part of its business strategy.", "Organon may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and Organon may not realize the expected benefits of any acquisition, license arrangement or strategic partnerships.", "Such opportunities may relate to products, technologies or operations with which Organon has limited or no historical experience.", "For example, Organon was not engaged in the medical device business, until its June 2021, acquisition of Alydia Health, a commercial-stage medical device company.", "In identifying, evaluating and selecting acquisition targets, Organon may encounter intense competition from other companies having a business objective similar to Organon's.", "Many of these companies are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting these types of strategic acquisitions.", "Moreover, some of these competitors may possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than Organon does.", "In addition, certain provisions of the tax matters agreement, which are intended to preserve the intended tax treatment of the spinoff and certain related transactions, may discourage, delay or prevent acquisition proposals or otherwise limit Organon's ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or engage in other transactions, including mergers or consolidations, for a period of time following the spinoff.", "Even if Organon is successful in making acquisitions, the products and technologies Organon acquires may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than it originally anticipated.", "Organon could experience negative effects on its results of operations and financial condition from acquisition-related charges, amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges.", "Organon could experience difficulties in integrating geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities, and personnel with diverse backgrounds.", "If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with Organon's existing business, its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.", "Organon may be unable to market its pharmaceutical products or medical devices if it does not obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals or marketing authorizations.", "Organon's activities, including the manufacturing and marketing of its pharmaceutical products and medical devices, are subject to extensive regulation by numerous federal and state governmental authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by foreign regulatory authorities, including in the EU, the UK, China and Japan.", "In the United States, the FDA administers requirements covering the laboratory testing, clinical trials, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals and medical devices.", "Regulation of Organon's pharmaceutical products outside the United States also is primarily focused on drug safety and effectiveness and, in many cases, reduction in the cost of drugs.", "In addition, regulatory authorities such as the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, China's NMPA and Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare have increased their focus on safety when assessing the benefit/risk balance of drugs.", "These regulatory authorities, including in China and Japan, also have substantial discretion to require additional testing, to delay or withhold registration and marketing approval and to otherwise preclude distribution and sale of a product.", "Organon currently markets one product in the United States regulated as a medical device, Jada (acquired through Organon's acquisition of Alydia Health, as described elsewhere in this report).", "In the future, Organon also plans to sell its medical devices in additional major international markets and will be subject to the regulatory requirements imposed in those jurisdictions.", "For example, in order to sell medical devices in EU member countries, Organon will need to comply with the MDR.", "Foreign sales outside the EU (including in the UK) are subject to the foreign government regulations of the relevant jurisdiction, and Organon will need to obtain approval or marketing authorization by the appropriate regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing activities in those countries.", "Organon cannot market its pharmaceutical products or medical devices or new indications or modifications to its existing products unless and until Organon has obtained all required regulatory approvals or marketing authorizations in each relevant jurisdiction.", "Organon's applications or submissions for regulatory approval or marketing authorization may be rejected or otherwise delayed by the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities.", "For example, the FDA may issue complete response letters indicating that Organon's applications for its pharmaceutical products are not ready for approval.", "Once obtained, Organon must maintain approval or marketing authorization as long as it plans to market products in each jurisdiction where approval or marketing authorization is required.", "The FDA or other regulators may change their policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions, which may prevent or delay regulatory approval or marketing", "authorization of Organon's future products or impact Organon's ability to modify its currently marketed products on a timely basis.", "Organon's failure to obtain approval, significant delays in the approval or marketing authorization process or its failure to maintain approval or marketing authorization in any jurisdiction will prevent Organon from selling the products in that jurisdiction.", "Organon would not be able to realize revenues for its pharmaceutical products or medical devices in any jurisdiction where it does not have approval or marketing authorization.", "Organon or its partners may fail to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of any of Organon's pharmaceutical product candidates or medical devices in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, which would prevent or delay development, regulatory approval or marketing authorization and commercialization of Organon's product candidates.", "Before obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities for the sale of Organon's pharmaceutical product candidates, Organon must demonstrate through lengthy pre-clinical studies and clinical trials that its product candidates are both safe and effective for use in each target indication.", "Obtaining marketing authorization for Organon's devices may also require pre-clinical and clinical trials.", "Pre-clinical and clinical trials are difficult to design and implement, and can take many years to complete, and their ultimate outcome is uncertain.", "Failure can occur at any time during the pre-clinical study and clinical trial processes.", "Accordingly, there is a high risk of failure and Organon may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval or marketing authorization of its product candidates.", "Organon may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent receipt of regulatory approval or marketing authorization, or Organon's ability to commercialize its product candidates, including for example, inability to recruit and enroll study subjects; failure of its product candidates in pre-clinical studies or clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy; receipt of feedback from the FDA and other regulatory authorities that require Organon to modify the design of its clinical trials; and negative or inconclusive clinical trial results that may require Organon to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon certain research and/or development programs.", " Organon may be required to conduct additional pre-clinical studies, clinical trials or other testing of its product candidates beyond those that it currently contemplates, or Organon may be unable to successfully complete pre-clinical studies or clinical trials of its product candidates or other testing in a timely manner.", "If the results of these studies, trials or tests are not positive (or are only modestly positive), or if there are safety concerns, Organon may incur unplanned costs, as well as delays in its efforts to obtain regulatory approval or marketing authorization.", "Even if Organon receives such approval, it may be more limited or restrictive than anticipated, or be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements.", "Developments following regulatory approval or marketing authorization may adversely affect sales of Organon's pharmaceutical products or medical devices.", "Even after a pharmaceutical product or medical device reaches the market, Organon continues to be subject to significant post-marketing regulatory requirements and oversight.", "The regulatory approvals or marketing authorizations that Organon may receive for its pharmaceutical products and medical devices will require the submission of reports to regulatory authorities and on-going surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of its products, may contain significant limitations related to use restrictions for specified groups, warnings, precautions or contraindications, and may include burdensome post-approval study or risk management requirements.", "In addition, even after a pharmaceutical product or device has obtained marketing authorization, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event and device malfunction reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, import, export, recalls and recordkeeping for Organon's products will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements, and Organon will be subject to periodic inspections.", "Failure to comply with any of these requirements could subject Organon to a variety of formal or informal enforcement actions by the FDA or other regulators, result in a recall or market withdrawal of Organon's products, require Organon to cease manufacturing and distribution of the products, trigger product liability or other litigation, or otherwise impact Organon's ability to realize revenues for its products.", "As previously disclosed, Organon voluntarily initiated market actions, including recalls, in certain markets with respect to the Company's suspension injections Diprospan, Celestone Chronodose® (betamethasone), and Celestone Soluspan® (betamethasone) related to a non-conforming component of a manufacturing line at Organon's Heist, Belgium plant.", "Organon does not believe this development will materially impact the company.", "It is possible that future recalls or similar developments could materially and adversely impact Organon's business, result of operations, and financial condition.", "Likewise, if previously unknown side effects, adverse events, malfunctions or other quality or safety concerns are discovered or if there is an increase in negative publicity regarding known side effects of any of Organon's products, it could significantly reduce demand for the product or require it to take actions that could negatively affect sales, including initiating corrections of a marketed product or removing the product from the market, restricting Organon's distribution or applying for marketing authorization for labeling changes.", "The FDA could also require Organon to conduct postmarketing studies of its products.", "Further, Organon is at risk for product liability and consumer protection claims and civil and criminal governmental actions", "related to its products, research and marketing activities.", "In addition, dissemination of promotional materials through evolving digital channels serves to increase visibility and scrutiny in the marketplace.", "Certain developments may decrease demand for Organon's products, including the following:", "•       negative results in post-approval Phase 4 trials or other studies;", "•       review by regulatory authorities or other expert bodies of Organon's products that are already marketed based on new data or other developments in the field;", "•       the recall, loss or modification of regulatory approval or marketing authorization of products that are already marketed; and", "•       changing government regulations regarding safety, efficacy, quality or labeling.", "Issues with product quality could have an

assuring the safety and efficacy of our products.", "While we have a quality system that covers the lifecycle of our products, quality and safety issues have and may in the future occur with respect to our products.", "A quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports, voluntary or official action indicated, warning letters, import bans, product recalls (either voluntary or required by FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries) or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions (which may include corporate integrity agreements), costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses.", "An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products.", "Our reputation and promising pipeline render our products prime targets for counterfeiters.", "Counterfeit products pose a significant risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured—often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites—as well as the lack of regulation of their contents.", "Failure to mitigate this threat could adversely impact our customers, potentially causing them harm.", "This, in turn, may result in the loss of confidence in our products' reputation and integrity, and potentially impact our business through lost sales, product recalls, and possible litigation.", "Certain of Organon's products

products is generally experienced.", "Expiry of patent protection and market exclusivity for products that contribute significantly to Organon's sales will adversely affect its business.", "Organon depends upon patents to provide it with exclusive marketing rights for certain of its products for some period of time.", "Loss of patent protection typically leads to a significant and rapid loss of sales for that product where lower priced generic versions of that drug become available.", "In the case of current or future products that contribute significantly to Organon's sales, a loss of market exclusivity could materially adversely affect its business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.", "For example, the patent that provided United States market exclusivity for NuvaRing expired in April 2018 and generic competition began in December 2019.", "Organon experienced a rapid and substantial decline in NuvaRing sales in the United States in 2020 as a result of this generic competition.", "Organon expects market exclusivity for Nexplanon in the United States to expire in 2027, and market exclusivity for the majority of countries where Nexplanon

depends on its patent rights for the marketing of certain of its products, and invalidation or circumvention of Organon's patent rights would adversely affect its business.", "Patent protections are important to the marketing of certain of Organon's products, particularly certain of its women's health products in the United States and in most major foreign markets.", "Patents covering products that Organon has introduced normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the successful marketing and sale of certain of its products.", "Even if Organon succeeds in obtaining patents covering its products, third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent Organon's patents and patent applications.", "It is important for Organon's business to successfully defend the patent rights that provide market exclusivity for its products.", "Organon is involved in patent disputes relating to challenges to its patents or claims by third parties of infringement against it.", "Organon defends its patents both within and outside the United States, including by filing claims of infringement against other parties.", "In particular, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products from time to time file abbreviated new drug applications with the FDA seeking to market generic forms of Organon's products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by it.", "Patent litigation and other challenges to Organon's patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive it of market exclusivity for a patented product or, in some cases, third-party patents may prevent Organon from marketing and selling a product in a particular geographic area, negatively affecting its business and results of operations.", "Additionally, certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies or in other circumstances, which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions and negatively affect Organon's business and results of operations.", "Further, court decisions relating to other companies’ patents, potential legislation in both the United States and certain foreign markets relating to patents, as well as regulatory initiatives, may result in a more general weakening of intellectual property protection.", "If one or more of Organon's important products lose patent protection in profitable markets, sales of those products are likely to decline significantly as a result of generic versions of those products becoming available.", "Organon's results of operations may be adversely affected by the lost sales unless and until it has launched commercially successful products that replace the lost sales.", "In addition, if products with intangible assets that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with acquisitions experience difficulties in the market that negatively affect product cash flows, Organon may recognize material non-cash impairment charges with respect to the value of those products.", "Organon is subject to minimum purchase obligations under certain supply agreements, and if Organon fails to meet those minimum purchase requirements, its financial results may be unfavorably impacted.", " Organon is subject to minimum purchase obligations under certain supply agreements, which requires Organon to purchase minimum amounts of materials critical to its product manufacturing over specified time periods.", "If Organon fails to meet these minimum purchase requirements, it may still be required to pay for the cost of the minimum inventory purchases.", "If Organon is unable to offset these payments, it could result in a lower margin.", "During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Organon recognized $5 million and $24 million, respectively, in Cost of Sales pertaining to estimated unavoidable losses associated with a long-term vendor supply contract conveyed as part of the spinoff.", "Organon is also aware of a limited number of other arrangements that have similar provisions which could result in these types of payments.", "Organon does not currently expect these payments to be material; however, in the aggregate they may become material if additional amounts are identified in the future, and they could have a material adverse effect on Organon's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.", "The health care industry in the United States has been, and will continue to be, subject to increasing regulation and political action.", "Organon believes that the health care industry will continue to be subject to increasing regulation and political and legal action at both the Federal and state levels.", "In 2010, the United States enacted major health care reform legislation in the form of the Patient Protection and the ACA.", "Since enactment of that law, various insurance market reforms have advanced and state and federal insurance exchanges were launched in 2014.", "The ACA also increased the mandated Medicaid rebate applicable to most branded drugs from 15.1% to 23.1% of the product's Average Manufacturer Price, expanded the rebate to Medicaid managed care utilization, and increased the types of entities eligible for the federal 340B drug discount program.", "The ACA, together with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, also requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay 70% (up from 50% from the", "ACA effective 2019) of the negotiated price of the medicine, including biosimilar products, when Medicare Part D beneficiaries are in the", "Medicare Part D coverage gap (i.e., the so-called \"donut hole provision\").", "Under the IRA, this coverage gap will be eliminated beginning January 1, 2025.", "The IRA requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay 10% of the negotiated price of brands, biologics and biosimilar products, when Medicare Part D beneficiaries are in the initial coverage phase, and 20% of the negotiated price during the catastrophic phase of Medicare Part D coverage.", "Also, certain pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to pay an annual non-tax deductible health care reform fee.", "The fee is assessed on each company in proportion to its share of prior year branded pharmaceutical sales to certain government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid.", "As discussed in \"Business—Competition and the Health Care Environment,\" there is significant uncertainty about the future of attempts to legislate health care reforms in the United States.", "For example, efforts to repeal, modify, or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ACA, some of which have been successful, create considerable uncertainties for Organon's business and other pharmaceutical manufacturers.", "There also has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the U.S. with respect to drug pricing practices.", "There have been, for example, several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries, hearings and proposed and enacted federal legislation and rules, as well as executive orders designed to, among other things, reduce or limit the price of drugs.", "On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the IRA, which, among other reforms, allows Medicare to: beginning in 2023, penalize drug companies that raise prices for products covered under Medicare Parts B and D faster than inflation.", "Organon cannot predict how these or future federal legislative proposals will affect it, and, beginning in 2026, establish a \"maximum fair price\" for certain high expenditure pharmaceutical and biological products covered under Medicare Parts B and D.", "In 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued the Medicaid rebate Final Rule that implemented provisions of the ACA effective April 1, 2016.", "The Final Rule provided comprehensive guidance on the calculation of Average Manufacturer Price and Best Price, which are two metrics that determine the rebates drug manufacturers are required to pay to state Medicaid programs.", "Under this Final Rule, among other provisions that have the effect of increasing Medicaid rebate liability, CMS requires manufacturers to include sales to the U.S.", "Territories in the calculation of AMP and Best Price; however, that provision was delayed several times and took effect on January 1, 2023.", "On December 31, 2020, CMS published a Final Rule on the Medicaid Program, which, among other things, introduced for the first time a regulatory definition of the terms \"line extension\" and \"new formulation.\"", "CMS defined \"line extension\" as \"a new formulation of the drug, but does not include an abuse-deterrent formulation of the drug[.]\"", "CMS adopted an expansive definition of \"new formulation\" to include \"a change to the drug, including, but not limited to: an extended release formulation or other change in release mechanism, a change in dosage form, strength, route of administration, or ingredients.\"", "This expanded definition may result in certain of Organon's drugs being subject to a higher Medicaid rebate liability.", "The new definitions of \"line extension\" and \"new formulation\" took effect on January 1, 2022.", "Finally, the provisions of this December 2020 Final Rule also may affect rebates owed under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program in certain circumstances where accumulator adjustment or similar programs are applied to Organon's drugs and the value of its assistance programs, which is intended for patients, is not counted towards the patient's deductible or other out-of-pocket costs.", "In 2020, the FDA issued a final rule implementing provisions of Section 804 of the FDCA, which allows the commercial importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada through FDA-authorized, time-limited programs sponsored by states or Indian tribes, and, in certain future circumstances, pharmacists and wholesalers.", "At that time, the FDA also released final guidance for industry detailing procedures for drug manufacturers to import FDA-approved prescription drug, biological, and combination products (approved under a NDA or Biologics License Application (BLA-)) that were manufactured abroad and authorized and originally intended for sale in a foreign country.", "A trade organization brought suit, which remains pending in federal district court, challenging the commercial importation final rule.", "These changes could have a material adverse effect on Organon's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.", "Changes to the health care system enacted as part of health care reform in the United States, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid and private sector beneficiaries, could result in further pricing pressures.", "As an example, health care reform has contributed to an increase in the number of patients in the Medicaid program under which sales of pharmaceutical products are subject to substantial rebates.", "Various executive and legislative actions in the United States have been proposed, or may in the future be proposed, to mandate reduced drug prices.", "For example, in November 2020, CMS issued a Final Rule that was intended to be effective January 1, 2021, which would have instituted a new pricing system for certain prescription drugs and biologic products covered by Medicare Part B, whereby Medicare would reimburse no more than the \"most favored nation price.\"", "The rule was immediately challenged in at least four federal courts and was rescinded by CMS on December 29, 2021.", "Additionally, in November 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (\"OIG\") issued a Final Rule, effective January 1, 2022, that eliminates the Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbor for rebates paid to Medicare Part D plans or to pharmacy benefit managers on behalf of such plans.", "The effectiveness of this Final Rule was delayed as part of the IRA, which was signed into law on August 16, 2022 and requires the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services not to implement, administer, or enforce the provisions of the Final Rule prior to January 1, 2032.", "As a result, it remains to be seen whether, and to what extent, the provisions of this Final Rule will take effect.", "While Organon cannot anticipate the effects of these changes to the way that it currently contracts, the new framework could significantly alter the way it does business with Part D Plan Sponsors and PBMs on behalf of such plans.", "Organon cannot predict the likelihood of additional future changes in the health care industry in general, the pharmaceutical industry in particular, or what impact they may have on its business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.", "Organon is subject to a variety of United States, other national and international laws and regulations, and Organon may face serious consequences for violations if it fails to meet the applicable legal and regulatory requirements.", "Organon is currently subject to a number of government laws and regulations and, in the future, could become subject to new government laws and regulations.", "The costs of compliance with such laws and regulations, or the negative results of non-compliance, could adversely affect Organon's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.", "The costs of compliance and penalties for noncompliance may be particularly significant with respect to health care reform initiatives in the United States or in other countries, including additional mandatory discounts or fees; new laws, regulations and judicial or other governmental decisions affecting pricing, reimbursement, and market access or marketing within or across jurisdictions; new and increasing data privacy regulations and enforcement, particularly in the EU, the UK, the United States, and China; legislative mandates or preferences for local manufacturing of medical products; emerging and new global

enforcement of anti-corruption laws.", "Our operations outside the United States could increase the risk of such violations.", "Organon's business is also heavily regulated and involves significant interaction with foreign officials.", "In many countries outside the U.S., prescribers of Organon products are employed by government entities, and purchasers are themselves government entities.", "As such, Organon's interactions with such prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA, as well as other similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations enacted by other countries.", "In addition to selling its products internationally, Organon currently engages third parties outside the United States, and may engage additional third parties outside the United States,

agents, contractors and other third-party collaborators, even if it does not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities.", "Enforcement activities under the laws and regulations described above may subject Organon to administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, preclusion from participating in public tenders, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences.", "Organon has significant global operations, which expose it to additional risks, and any adverse event could adversely affect Organon's results of operations and financial condition.", "The extent of Organon's operations outside the United States is significant.", "For example, in 2022, Organon generated $4.7 billion in revenues outside the United States, representing approximately 77% of its total revenues.", "Risks inherent in conducting a global business include:", "•       changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs and pricing restrictions in key markets;", "•       multiple

addition, Organon's operations and performance may be affected by political or civil unrest or military action.", "As a result of global economic conditions, some parties may delay or be unable to satisfy their payment or reimbursement obligations.", "Job losses or other economic hardships may also affect patients' ability to afford health care as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost health care insurance coverage or for other reasons.", "Further, with rising international trade tensions or sanctions, Organon's business may be adversely affected following new or increased tariffs, as well as the costs of materials, products, and commodities upon which Organon rely.", "As a result, changes in international trade policy, changes in trade agreements and the imposition of tariffs or sanctions by the U.S. or other countries could materially adversely affect Organon's results of operations and financial condition.", "In particular, in February 2022, the armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia escalated, which may adversely impact Organon's business.", "Specifically, trade sanctions, travel bans and asset/financial freezes announced by the United States, European Union and other countries against Russian entities and designated individual restrictions have impacted and

officers.", "Further, the GDPR prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA that are not considered by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of data protection, including to the United States, except if the data controller meets very specific requirements.", "Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in significant monetary fines and other administrative penalties as well as civil liability claims from individuals whose personal data was processed.", "Data protection authorities from the different EU Member States may still enforce the GDPR differently, reflecting variations that arise under national-level regulations and guidelines (e.g., labor laws, processing of national identification numbers), which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU.", "Guidance at both EU level and at the national level in individual EU Member States concerning implementation and compliance practices is often updated or otherwise revised, resulting in a challenging regulatory environment.", "There is, moreover, a growing trend towards required public disclosure of clinical trial data in the EU, which adds to the complexity of obligations relating to processing health data from clinical trials.", "Failing to comply with these obligations could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against Organon, harm to its reputation, and adversely impact its business and operating results.", "The uncertainty regarding the interplay between different regulatory frameworks further adds to the complexity that Organon faces with regard to data protection regulation.", "Additional laws and

impact Organon's business, operations, financial performance, results of operations, and financial condition.", "Organon's business and financial results were negatively impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19.", "During 2022, our product sales in China declined by approximately $46 million, primarily as a result of lockdowns and clinic closures in selected cities, as well as a decline in patient visits to the remaining in-patient and out-patient clinics.", "A significant amount of Organon's revenue is comprised of physician prescribed products, which, despite underlying demand, have been affected by reduced access, fewer medical visits and delays in elective procedures.", "Additionally, our portfolio in women's health includes products that are physician administered, which have been affected by reduced access to physicians and health care centers.", "These impacts, have resulted in reduced prescription of many products within established brands and women's health, such as Nexplanon, in some countries outside the U.S., as well as our Fertility brands.", "The extent to which an epidemic and /or pandemic impacts Organon's business going forward will depend on future

manufacturing from many suppliers and vendors in various countries, including sometimes from itself for self-supplied requirements.", "Organon endeavors to achieve, either alone or by working closely with its suppliers, continuity of Organon's inputs and supplies, but it cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful.", "For instance, Follistim AQ and Atozet¹ have been challenged by intermittent supply disruptions.", "Further, while efforts are made to diversify certain of Organon's sources of components and materials, in certain instances there is only a sole source or it would require months or years to establish an alternative supplier.", "For many of Organon's components and materials for which a single source or supplier is used, alternative sources or suppliers may exist, but Organon has made a strategic determination to use the single source or supplier.", "Although Organon does carry strategic inventory and maintain insurance to help mitigate the potential risk related to any related supply disruption, it cannot assure investors that such measures will always be sufficient or effective.", "Further, if Organon does seek recovery or damages from such supplier for any supply shortages or disruptions, such recovery or damages may be limited and not include indirect or consequential losses or any loss of revenue or lost profits.", "Organon's ability to achieve continuity of its supply may also be affected by public health crises and epidemics/pandemics.", "A reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to quickly develop acceptable alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect Organon's ability to manufacture and distribute its products in a timely or cost-effective manner, negatively impacting Organon's ability to sell its products.", "Organon may not realize benefits from its investments in emerging markets.", "Organon has been taking steps to increase its sales in emerging markets; however, Organon's efforts to expand sales in these markets may not succeed.", "Some countries within emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of global financial instability or may have very limited resources to spend on health care.", "In order for Organon to successfully implement its emerging markets strategy, Organon must attract and retain qualified personnel.", "Organon may also be required to increase Organon's reliance on third-party agents within less developed markets.", "In addition, many of these countries have currencies that fluctuate substantially and, if such currencies devalue and Organon cannot offset the devaluations, its financial performance within such countries could be adversely affected.", "For example, Organon's business in China is growing, and China is now Organon's second largest market, thereby increasing the importance of China to Organon's overall pharmaceutical business.", "Continued growth of Organon's business in China depends upon ongoing development of a favorable regulatory environment, sustained availability of Organon's currently marketed products within China, and Organon's ability to mitigate the impact of any trade impediments or adverse pricing controls.", "Pricing pressure in China has increased as the Chinese government has been taking steps to reduce costs, including implementing health care reform that has led to the acceleration of generic substitution, where available.", "While pricing pressure has always existed in China, health care reform has increased this pressure in part due to the acceleration of generic substitution through the government's VBP and GQCE programs.", "In 2019, the government implemented the VBP program through a tendering process for products that have generic substitutes with a GQCE approval.", "Mature products that have entered into the first seven rounds of VBP have had, on average, a price reduction of approximately 50%.", "Organon expects VBP to be a semi-", "annual process that will have a significant impact on mature products moving forward, which Organon expects to increase pricing pressure on its products in China.", "There are 300 molecules currently included under VBP, and it is expected that an aggregate of 500 molecules will be subject to VBP by 2025.", "Furthermore, the Chinese government has started its efforts to conform the reimbursement price between GQCE-approved generic products and the applicable originator products.", "The URPS policy will create additional pricing and volume pressure for pharmaceutical products that are subject to the program and may adversely affect Organon's business and results of operations.", "In addition, Organon currently relies on a third-party manufacturer to import, repackage and then sell a significant portion of its products in China.", "China's regulatory landscape continues to evolve, including reform of the Market Authorization Holder, or MAH, system and change of registration and licensing requirements for imported pharmaceutical products.", "These regulatory changes may limit the ability for the third-party manufacturer to continue to sell Organon's products to downstream distributors.", "The regulatory authority has not made it clear in the existing regulatory framework a pathway for selling these repackaged products to public hospitals.", "If Organon fails to identify a pathway forward, its business in China may be adversely affected.", "Finally, Organon plans to pivot in China from a primary focus on the public tender market to growth opportunities in the private retail segment.", "A failure to make such pivot effectively, or a failure to develop and maintain a presence in emerging markets could adversely affect Organon's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.", "Current market conditions and recessionary pressures in one or more of our markets could impact our ability to grow our business.", "Over the last few years in the U.S. and globally, market and economic conditions have been challenging.", "Non-U.S. countries, particularly in Europe, have experienced recessionary pressures and face continued concerns about the systemic impacts of adverse economic conditions and geopolitical issues.", "Any negative impact on economic conditions and international markets, continued volatility or deterioration in the capital markets, inflation, deflation or other adverse economic conditions may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.", "It may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.", "Ongoing uncertain economic and financial market conditions may also adversely affect the financial condition of our customers, suppliers and other business partners.", "If our customers' financial conditions are adversely affected, those customers may reduce their purchases of our products or we may not be able to collect accounts receivable, each of which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations or financial results, and we may not be able to fully absorb any such additional costs or revenue declines in the prices for our products and services.", "Inflation could materially adversely affect our business and operations.", "Our operating results could be materially impacted by changes in the overall macroeconomic environment and other economic factors that impact our cost structure and revenue results.", "Changes in economic conditions, supply chain constraints, logistics challenges, labor shortages, the war in Ukraine, and steps taken by governments and central banks, as well as other stimulus and spending programs, have led to higher inflation, which is likely to lead to an increase in costs and may cause changes in fiscal and monetary policy, including increased interest rates.", "In a higher inflationary environment, we may be unable to raise the prices of our products and services sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation.", "Organon is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates.", "Organon operates in multiple jurisdictions and virtually all of its sales outside the United States are denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar.", "Additionally, Organon has historically entered into, and will in the future enter into, business development transactions, borrowings or other financial transactions that may give rise to currency and interest rate exposure.", "Since Organon cannot, with certainty, foresee and mitigate against such adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates and inflation could negatively affect Organon's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.", "In order to mitigate the adverse impact of these market fluctuations, Organon enters into hedging agreements from time to time.", "While hedging agreements, such as currency options and forwards and interest rate swaps, may limit some of the exposure to exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, such attempts to mitigate these risks may be costly and not always successful.", "As a result, currency fluctuations among Organon's reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, and other currencies in which Organon does business will affect its operating results, often in unpredictable ways.", "Reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could materially adversely affect Organon's business.", "Organon depends on third parties, including other suppliers, alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and third-party service providers, for key aspects of Organon's business, including development, manufacture and commercialization of its products (including supplying its products or key ingredients of its products) and support for its IT systems.", "In addition, in connection with the interim operating arrangements Organon has been establishing following the spinoff, Organon may enter into agreements with third-parties in certain jurisdictions, including China, to continue its business operations in compliance with local regulatory requirements.", "Failure of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory and other obligations to Organon or the development of factors that materially disrupt the relationships between it and these third parties could adversely affect Organon's business.", "The markets for Organon's products, including the women's health market, may not develop as successfully as expected.", "Organon's focus on women's health is a key component of its strategy.", "Organon's ability to successfully execute its growth strategy in this area is subject to numerous risks, including:", "•       uncertainty of the development of a market for such products;", "•       trends relating to, or the introduction or existence of, competing products, technologies or alternative treatments or therapies that may be more effective, safer or easier to use than Organon's products, technologies, treatments or therapies;", "•       the perception of Organon's products as compared to other products;", "•       recommendation and support for the use of Organon's products or treatments by influential customers, such as obstetricians, gynecologists, reproductive endocrinologists and treatment centers;", "•       changes in government policy or regulations could impair or repeal contraception coverage mandates under the ACA or state laws, which may affect payments to Organon or impose additional coverage limitations or cost-sharing obligations on its patients;", "•       the availability and extent of data demonstrating the clinical efficacy of Organon's products or treatments;", "•       competition, including the presence of competing products sold by companies with longer operating histories, more recognizable names and more established distribution networks; and", " If Organon is unable to successfully commercialize and create a significant market for its women's health products, Organon's business or prospects could be harmed.", "Our business and operations are subject to risks related to climate change.", "The effects of global climate change present risks to our business.", "Natural disasters, extreme weather and other conditions caused by or related to climate change could adversely impact our supply chain, including manufacturing and distribution networks, the availability and cost of raw materials and components, energy supply, transportation, or other inputs necessary for the operation of our business.", "Climate change and natural disasters could also result in physical damage to our facilities as well as those of our suppliers, customers, and other business partners, which could cause disruption in our business and operations or increase costs to operate our business.", "Additionally, increased environmental regulation, including to address climate change, may result in increases in our costs to operate our business or restrict certain aspects of our activities.", "The extent and severity of climate change impacts are unknown, and therefore, the scope of potential impact on our business may be difficult to predict and it may be difficult to adequately prepare.", "Biosimilars carry unique regulatory risks and uncertainties, which could adversely affect Organon's results of operations and financial condition.", "There are unique regulatory risks and uncertainties related to biosimilars.", "The regulation of the testing, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling and marketing of biosimilars are subject to regulation by the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory bodies.", "These laws and regulations differ from, and are not as well-established as, those governing pharmaceutical products or the approval of generic pharmaceutical products.", "In addition, manufacturing biosimilars, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies to handle living cells and microorganisms.", "Any changes to the regulatory framework governing biosimilars or in the ability of Organon's partners to manufacture an adequate supply of biosimilars may adversely affect Organon's ability to commercialize the biosimilars in its portfolio.", "Organon relies on its collaboration with Samsung Bioepis and Henlius for the successful development and manufacture of Organon's biosimilars products and expects to do so for the foreseeable future.", "Organon's current biosimilars portfolio consists primarily of products developed and

successful relationship with Samsung Bioepis and Henlius.", "The success of Organon's commercialization activities may also depend, in part, on the performance, operations and regulatory compliance of Samsung Bioepis and Henlius and their suppliers, over which Organon does not have control.", "Organon cannot assure investors that its collaboration will be successful or that it will achieve the benefits of its collaborations.", "Organon has incurred substantial indebtedness, which could adversely affect Organon's financial condition and results of operations.", "At December 31, 2022, Organon had outstanding indebtedness of approximately $8.9 billion, as described more fully in the Notes to its financial statements.", "In addition, Organon may incur additional debt from time to time to finance acquisitions or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents that govern its indebtedness.", "Current or future levels of indebtedness may increase the possibility that Organon will be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay amounts due in respect of such indebtedness.", "Organon's ability to issue additional debt or enter into other financing

to dedicate a significant portion of its cash flows from operations to paying amounts due under its indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for other corporate purposes;", "•       making Organon more vulnerable to economic downturns; or •   limiting Organon's ability to withstand competitive pressures.", "Any of these restrictions on Organon's ability to operate its business in its discretion could adversely affect its business by, among other things, limiting Organon's ability to adapt to changing economic, financial or industry conditions and to take advantage of corporate

Opinion.", "If the spinoff is ultimately determined to be taxable, the spinoff could be treated as a taxable dividend to Merck's stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and Merck's stockholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.", "In addition, Merck would recognize a taxable gain to the extent that the fair market value of Organon Common Stock exceeds Merck's tax basis in such stock on the date of the spinoff.", "Each of Merck and Organon generally will be responsible for any tax-related losses imposed on Merck or Organon as a result of the failure of a transaction to qualify for tax-free treatment, to the extent that the failure to so qualify is attributable to actions, events or transactions relating to Merck's or Organon's respective stock,

"This volatility could negatively impact Organon's ability to raise additional capital or utilize equity as consideration in any acquisition transactions Organon may seek to pursue, and could make it more difficult for existing stockholders to sell their shares of the Common Stock at a price they consider acceptable or at all.", "This volatility is caused by a variety of factors, including, among the other risks described in this report:", "•       Organon's liquidity and ability to obtain additional capital, including the market's reaction to any capital-raising transaction Organon may pursue;", "•       declining working capital to fund operations, or other signs of financial uncertainty;", "•       any negative decisions by the FDA or comparable regulatory bodies outside the

are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and encouraging prospective acquirors to negotiate with Organon's Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover.", "Specifically, because Organon has not chosen to be exempt from Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that stockholders may favor.", "Section 203 provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation may not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or their affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation's outstanding voting

with Organon's first annual meeting of stockholders, provide for a classified Board of Directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term, which could have the effect of making the replacement of incumbent directors more time consuming and difficult;", "•       provide that as long as Organon's Board of Directors is classified, Organon's directors can be removed for cause only; •       prohibit stockholder action by written consent;", "•       provide that special meetings of stockholders can be called only by the Board of Directors;", "•       provide that vacancies on the Board of Directors could be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director; and", "•       establish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations of candidates for election as directors.", "Organon believes these provisions will protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with Organon's Board of Directors and by providing its Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal.", "These provisions are not intended to make Organon immune from takeovers.", "However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that Organon's Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of Organon and its stockholders.", "These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove

capacity or (ii) as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery, will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be exclusively brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court does not have jurisdiction, another state court or a federal court located within the State of Delaware.", "Furthermore, unless Organon selects or
