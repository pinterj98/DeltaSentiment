committed to being responsive to the effects of climate change and reducing our carbon footprint, there can be no assurances that our goals and strategic plans to achieve those goals will be successful, that the costs related to climate transition will not be higher than expected, that the necessary technological advancements will occur in the timeframe we expect, or at all, that the severity of and or the pace of negative climate-related effects will not accelerate faster than expected, or that proposed regulation or deregulation related to climate change will not have a negative competitive impact, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures or other expenses, revenue or results of operations.", "Furthermore, methodologies for reporting climate-related information may change and previously reported information may be adjusted to reflect new reporting protocols or regulations, improvements in the availability and quality of third-party data, changing assumptions, changes in the nature and scope of our operations and other changes in circumstances.", "Our processes and controls for reporting climate-related information across our operations are evolving along with multiple disparate standards for identifying, measuring and reporting sustainability metrics, including disclosures that may be required by the SEC, European and other regulators, and such standards may change over time, which could result in significant revisions to our current goals, reported progress in achieving such goals, or our ability to achieve such goals in the future.", "Changes in regulation or technology impacting our business could require us to write down the carrying value of assets, which could result in material impairment charges.", "Moreover, we may determine that it is in our best interests to prioritize other business, social, governance or sustainable investments over the achievement of our current goals based on economic, regulatory or social factors, business strategy or other factors.", "If we do not meet these goals or there is perception that we failed to meet these goals, then, in addition to regulatory and legal risks related to compliance, we could incur adverse publicity and reaction, which could adversely impact our reputation, and in turn adversely impact our results of operations.", "Severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters could materially adversely affect us.", "Weather conditions or other natural or man-made disasters and the increased severity or frequency thereof

the past and may in the future disrupt our business.", "Customers may reduce shipments, supply chains may be disrupted, demand may be negatively impacted or our costs to operate our business may increase, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.", "Any such event affecting one of our major facilities could result in a significant interruption in or disruption of our business.", "A potential result of climate change is more frequent or more severe weather events or natural disasters.", "To the extent such weather events or natural disasters do become more frequent or severe, disruptions to our business and those of our customers and costs to repair damaged facilities or maintain or resume operations could increase.", "Furthermore, climate change may reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance for these negative impacts of natural disasters and adverse weather conditions by contributing to an increase in the incidence and severity of such natural disasters.", "Economic, political, or social developments and other risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect us.", "We have significant international operations and, as a result, we are exposed to changing economic, political and social developments in a number of countries, all of which are beyond our control.", "Emerging markets are often more volatile than those in other countries, and any broad-based downturn in these markets could reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "We are subject to many laws governing our international operations, including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and commercial customers, govern our environmental impact or labor matters, and restrict where we can do business, our shipments to certain countries and the information that we can provide to non-U.S. governments.", "Our failure to manage and anticipate these and other risks associated with our international operations could materially adversely affect us.", "Our inability to effectively integrate any acquired businesses and realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances or dispositions could materially adversely affect us.", "From time to time we acquire businesses, form joint ventures and strategic alliances, and dispose of operations.", "Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends, in part, upon successful integration between the businesses involved, the performance of the underlying operations, capabilities or technologies and the management of the acquired operations.", "Accordingly, our financial results could be materially adversely affected by our failure to effectively integrate acquired operations, unanticipated performance or other issues or transaction-related charges.", "Changing fuel and energy prices, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, and interruptions in supplies of these commodities could materially adversely affect us.", "Fuel and energy costs have a significant impact on our operations.", "We require significant quantities of fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risks associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.", "We seek to mitigate our exposure to changing fuel prices through our pricing strategy and may utilize hedging transactions from time to time.", "There can be no assurance that this strategy will be effective.", "If we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges, higher fuel costs could materially adversely impact our operating results.", "Even if we are able to offset changes in fuel costs with surcharges, high fuel surcharges have in the past, and may in the future result in a shift from our higher-yielding products to lower-yielding products or an overall reduction in volume, revenue and profitability.", "Moreover, we could experience a disruption in energy supplies as a result of new or increased regulation, war or other conflicts, weather-related events or natural disasters, actions by producers (including as part of their own sustainability efforts) or other factors beyond our control, which could have a material adverse effect on us.",

derived from operations outside the United States.", "Our international operations are affected by changes in the exchange rates for local currencies, in particular the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Renminbi and Hong Kong Dollar.", "We are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on our short-term debt and that portion of our long-term debt that carries floating interest rates.", "Additionally, changes in interest rates impact the valuation of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the related costs recognized in the statements of consolidated income.", "The impact of changes in interest rates on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and costs, and on our debt, is discussed further in Part I, \"Item 7 - Critical Accounting Estimates,\" and Part II, \"Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\", respectively, of this report.", "We monitor and manage foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate exposures, and use derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in these rates on our financial condition and results of operations; however, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates cannot always be predicted or effectively hedged, and may have a material adverse effect on us.", "Our business requires significant capital and other investments; if we do not accurately forecast our future investment needs, we could be materially adversely affected.", "Our business requires significant capital investments, including in aircraft, vehicles, technology, facilities and sortation and other equipment.", "In addition to forecasting our capital investment requirements, we adjust other elements of our operations and cost structure in response to economic and regulatory conditions.", "These investments support both our existing business and anticipated growth.", "Forecasting amounts, types and timing of investments involves many factors which are subject to uncertainty and may be beyond our control, such as general economic trends, revenues, profitability, changes in governmental regulation and competition.", "If we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs, we could under- or over-invest, or have excess capacity or insufficient capacity, any of which could negatively affect our revenues and profitability.", "Employee health and retiree health and pension benefit costs represent a significant expense to us; further cost increases could materially adversely affect us.", "Our employee health, retiree health and pension benefit expenses are significant.", "In recent years, we have experienced increases in some of these costs, in particular, ongoing increases in healthcare costs in excess of the rate of inflation and historically low discount rates that we use to value our company-sponsored defined benefit plan obligations.", "Increasing healthcare costs, volatility in investment returns and discount rates, as well as changes in laws, regulations and assumptions used to calculate retiree health and pension benefit expenses, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations, and have required, and may in the future require significant contributions to our benefit plans.", "Our national master agreement with the Teamsters includes provisions that are designed to mitigate certain healthcare expenses, but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that these efforts will not materially adversely affect us.", "We participate in various trustee-managed multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements.", "As part of the overall collective bargaining process for wage and benefit levels, we have agreed to contribute certain amounts to the multiemployer benefit plans during the contract period.", "The multiemployer benefit plans set benefit levels and are responsible for benefit delivery to participants.", "Future contribution amounts to multiemployer benefit plans will be determined through collective bargaining.", "However, in future collective bargaining negotiations, we could agree to make significantly higher future contributions to one or more of these plans.", "At this time, we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions, if any, or whether any material adverse effect on us could result from our participation in these plans.", "In addition to our ongoing multiemployer pension plan obligations, we may have an obligation in the future to pay significant coordinating benefits previously earned by UPS employees in the Central States Pension Fund (the \"CSPF\").", "For additional information on our potential liabilities related to the CSPF, see note 5 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.", "Insurance and claims expense could materially adversely affect us.", "We have a combination of both self-insurance and high-deductible insurance programs for the risks arising out of our business and operations, including claims exposure resulting from cargo loss, personal injury, property damage, aircraft and related liabilities, business interruption and workers' compensation.", "Self-insured workers' compensation, automobile and general liabilities are determined using actuarial estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but not reported claims, on an undiscounted basis.", "Our accruals for insurance reserves reflect certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments, which are subject to a high degree of variability.", "If the number, severity or cost of claims for which we retain risk continues to increase, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.", "If we lose our ability to, or decide not to, self-insure these risks, our insurance cost could materially increase and we may find it difficult to obtain adequate levels of insurance coverage.", "Changes in markets and our business plans have resulted, and may in the future result, in substantial impairments of the carrying value of our assets, thereby reducing our net income.", "We regularly assess the carrying values of our assets relative to their estimated fair values.", "If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value, we may be required to incur charges to reduce the carrying value thereof.", "The determination of fair value is dependent on a significant number of estimates and assumptions that could be impacted by a variety of factors, including changes in business strategy, revenue, expenses, government regulations, including regulation related to climate change, costs of capital and economic or market conditions.", "The use of different estimates or assumptions could also result in different estimates of fair value.", "Our estimates of fair value have resulted from time to time, and may in the future result, in substantial impairments of our assets.", "For example, during the year ended December 31, 2023, as a result of a number of factors including changes in business strategy and challenging macroeconomic conditions such as increases in the risk-free interest rate and volatility of the stock prices of market comparables, we incurred impairment charges of $125 and $111 million in respect of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively.", "In addition, we have been and may be required in the future to recognize increased depreciation and amortization charges if we determine the useful lives or salvage values of our assets are less than we originally estimated.", "Such changes have in the past, and may in the future, reduce our net income.", "We may have significant additional tax liabilities that could materially adversely affect us.", "We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions.", "Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.", "There are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.", "We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in many jurisdictions.", "Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue may make resolving tax disputes more difficult.", "The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.", "In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions may materially adversely impact our tax expense and cash flows.", "Increasingly complex and stringent laws, regulations and policies could materially increase our operating costs.", "We are subject to complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, security, labor, employment, safety, privacy, disclosure and data protection and other governmental laws, regulations and policies, both in the U.S. and internationally.", "In addition, we are impacted by laws, regulations and policies that affect global trade, including tariff and trade policies, export requirements, embargoes, sanctions, taxes, monetary policies and other restrictions and charges.", "Trade discussions and arrangements between the U.S. and various of its trading partners are fluid, and existing and future trade agreements are, and are expected to continue to be, subject to a number of uncertainties, including the imposition of new tariffs or adjustments and changes to the products covered by existing tariffs.", "The impact of new laws, regulations and policies or decisions or interpretations by authorities applying those laws and regulations, cannot be predicted.", "Compliance with any new laws, regulations or policies may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures.", "Any failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or policies in the U.S. or other countries could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations, which could materially adversely affect us.", "Increasingly stringent regulations related to climate change, including reporting obligations, could materially increase our operating costs.", "Regulation and required disclosures of greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions and related matters exposes us to potentially significant new taxes, fees, disclosure and compliance obligations and other costs.", "Compliance with such regulation, and any increased or additional regulation, or the associated costs is further complicated by the fact that various countries and regions may adopt different approaches to climate change regulation and disclosures.", "For example, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (\"CORSIA\"), a global, market-based emissions offset program to encourage carbon-neutral growth began a voluntary pilot phase in 2021, with mandatory participation scheduled to begin in 2027.", "The International Civil Aviation Organization, which adopted CORSIA, continues to develop details regarding implementation, but compliance with CORSIA is expected to increase our operating costs, potentially significantly.", "In the U.S., Congress has considered but, to date, not passed various bills that would regulate GHG emissions.", "Nevertheless, we believe some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future.", "Even in the absence of such legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency could determine to regulate GHG emissions, especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions, and this could impose substantial costs on us.", "In addition, the impact that participation in the Paris Climate Accords may have on future U.S. policy regarding GHG emissions, on CORSIA and on other GHG regulation remains uncertain.", "The extent to which other countries implement that accord could also have a material adverse effect on us.", "Increased regulation relating to GHG emissions in the U.S. or abroad, especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions, could, among other things, increase the cost of fuel and other energy we purchase and the capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely.", "We cannot predict the impact any future regulation will have on our cost structure or our operating results.", "It is likely that such regulation could significantly increase our operating costs and that we may not be willing or able to pass such costs along to our customers.", "Moreover, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the GHGs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services, especially our air services.", "Furthermore, many countries, as well as U.S. states, in which we operate or are subject to regulation have adopted, or are expected to adopt, additional requirements relating to the disclosure of GHG emissions and related matters.", "In many cases these requirements differ and may conflict from country to country.", "Compliance with these disclosure requirements may increase our operating costs or require significant management time and attention.", "Any failure to comply with applicable disclosure regulations in the U.S. (at either the federal or state level) or other countries could result in substantial fines or other penalties, which could materially adversely affect us.", "We may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures which may materially adversely affect us.", "The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, property damage, business practices, environmental liability and other matters.", "Any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could result in significant expenditures and have a material adverse effect on us.", "For information about our executive officers, see Part III, \"Item 10.", "Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\".", "The Board regularly discusses our most significant risks and how these risks are being managed.", "The Board has appointed a Risk Committee, consisting entirely

privacy, technology, information security, cybersecurity and cyber incident response and business continuity.", "The Risk Committee regularly updates the Board on these activities.", "The Risk Committee oversees the Company’s approach to cybersecurity risk assessment and mitigation by, among other things,", "(i) reviewing the Company’s cybersecurity insurance program, (ii) reviewing the Company’s cybersecurity budget, (iii) discussing the results of various internal cybersecurity audits and periodic independent third-party assessments of the Company’s cybersecurity programs, (iv) being briefed on cybersecurity matters by outside experts, and (v) receiving regular updates from the Company’s Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) and others on cybersecurity risks, operational metrics, compliance and regulatory developments, training programs, risk mitigation activities, key projects and industry developments.", "The Company's Chief Legal and Compliance Officer (\"CLCO\"), Chief Digital and Technology Officer (\"CDTO\"), CISO and Vice President of Compliance and Internal Audit participate in Risk Committee meetings and meet individually with the Risk
